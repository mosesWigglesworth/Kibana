You: 

Here we go. The first transcript on "Introduction to the course". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Hello, and welcome to this course! I am super excited to teach you Kibana, but before we get started, I want to take a short moment to introduce myself and the course. My name is Bo Andersen, and I will be your instructor for this course. I’m a software developer from Denmark. I started out doing backend web development for a number of small companies, before eventually transitioning more into the data analysis space. I have worked for online marketing companies my whole career, so finding value in data has naturally been a big part of my job. Besides teaching here at Udemy, I am a partner and CTO at a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, also in the online marketing industry. As part of that, I use the Elastic Stack on a daily basis for powering our business, which of course includes Kibana. This includes data analysis and observability. As a developer, I have experience with many other technologies as you can see on your screen. I don’t want to ramble on too much about myself, so that was just a quick overview of why I believe I am qualified to teach you Kibana. So that was a bit about me, but what about you? Perhaps you already have some experience with Kibana, or perhaps you don’t. This course starts from the absolute beginning and guides you through the process of learning Kibana, step by step. Therefore you don’t need to know anything about Kibana already, but you do need to know the very basics of Elasticsearch. That’s because Kibana works with Elasticsearch documents, and so you will need to know the basics of documents, mappings, aggregations, and such. Don’t worry, no deep knowledge of Elasticsearch is required, so things won’t get very complicated in that regard — I promise. Whatever experience you have or don’t have with Kibana, you have come to the right place! I have put a lot of effort into introducing concepts gradually, instead of giving you an information overload. For the most part, you won’t need the Kibana documentation for the topics covered in this course. Of course not everything is covered, since there are a lot of Kibana features, but I have taken the most important concepts and included them in the course. The scope of this course is Kibana, and not the Elastic Stack as a whole. We will be using a couple of Elasticsearch features here and there, but other than that, this course focuses exclusively on Kibana features. The reason for that is that the Elastic Stack is a huge piece of technology, and so covering everything in a single course is not feasible — at least not when going into any significant detail, which I pride myself in doing. In context, my Elasticsearch course contains over 15 hours of content, and it still doesn’t cover all subjects. If I were to cover Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, etc. in a single course, I am sure you can imagine how this would end up being a 40+ hour course. And that’s not useful to someone who just wants to learn Kibana. I want to go into detail rather than just scratching the surface; otherwise you could just watch an introduction to Kibana on YouTube. This is why I have several courses covering different parts of the Elastic Stack. So if you are interested in other parts of the Elastic Stack, then I encourage you to check out my other courses here at Udemy. Alright, so what will you learn in this course? You will learn the fundamentals of Kibana, being everything from visualizations to dashboards, users, roles, spaces, reporting, alerting, etc. Pretty much everything that’s important to know about Kibana. In fact, I dare say that this is by far the most comprehensive course on Kibana here on Udemy. The course is continuously being updated, so for a complete list of what is covered, please check the course curriculum. It should be said, though, that the course doesn’t focus on specific use cases. For instance, Kibana contains so-called solutions that orchestrate multiple Elastic Stack products. For instance, the APM solution — short for Application Performance Management — is tightly coupled with Elasticsearch and also requires an agent to be installed and integrated into application code. Covering such a solution, we would spend most of our time doing things that are not related to Kibana. This course is therefore a general purpose Kibana course that is not dedicated to specific use cases. Lastly, I want to remind you that captions are available for this course. So if you prefer to have the spoken words written out on your screen during the lectures, then be sure to enable those within the video player. And with that, let’s get started learning Kibana!"

Shall we move on to the next part of Section 1?

You: 

Next one is "Introduction to Kibana". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "So what is Kibana? You probably already have an idea since you found this course, but here is a quick introduction anyway. Kibana is an open source user interface that is used to visualize and analyze Elasticsearch data. The interface is accessible through a browser, and Kibana ships with a built-in web server. The Kibana server communicates with an Elasticsearch cluster to retrieve its data. Kibana also stores all of its data within Elasticsearch indices. This is convenient, because it means that we don’t have to manage a database with this data and handle things such as backups. If we lose the server on which Kibana is running, we still have all of our data within our Elasticsearch cluster, and we can continue where we left off on a new instance. Alright, so what can we actually do with Kibana? We can build visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, maps, heat maps, gauges, tag clouds, etc. Basically any visualization type you would expect. These visualizations generally make use of Elasticsearch aggregations under the hood. With these visualizations, we can build dashboards to create an overview of our data. An example could be to show the hardware utilization of servers, or to display application metrics. Dashboards can be created for people with different roles, which you can see an example of on your screen. They can be interacted with to dynamically slice and dice data, so dashboards are not necessarily static. We can create users with each of their credentials and have a user for each employee in a company, for instance. We can then control what they have access to with roles and spaces. For instance, we could have a space for the sales department, and one for the system administration department, both showing different things. That’s useful because we probably don’t want sales managers being able to see our server monitoring, while system administrators probably don’t need access to sales data. While showing data within Kibana is great, sometimes we might want to show things in a different context. Kibana enables us to share data in a number of ways, whether it’s visualizations, dashboards, or even raw data. For instance, we can download a dashboard as PDF, which can then be sent to a colleague, boss, customer — or anyone, really. We can also download PNG images of visualizations and use them within presentations, for instance. Or, we can share links to dashboards, and even embed them within other web pages. Needless to say, regardless of how we visualize our data, those visualizations are not stuck within Kibana. We can also set up alerting within Kibana and be notified when certain criteria is fulfilled. An example could be that we want to be alerted if there is a sudden increase in internal server errors on our website. Or if the CPU usage of a server exceeds 85%. Each alert is based on data within an Elasticsearch index. We define the alert condition, how often the alert should be checked, and how often we should be notified if the condition evaluates to true. We can then be notified in a number of ways such as email, Slack, or webhooks. That was a quick overview of Kibana. Surely there is much more to Kibana than that, but those were some of the highlights."

Shall we move on to the next transcript?

You: 

Next one is "Overview of Installation Options". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Now that you have been introduced to Kibana, let’s get started actually doing something with it. The first step in doing so is to set up Kibana. Since Kibana requires an Elasticsearch cluster, you will need to set that up as well. There are essentially two approaches that you can choose; to set up Elasticsearch and Kibana on your own machine or to run everything in the cloud. By cloud, I am referring to Elastic Cloud, which is the official cloud solution from the company behind the Elastic Stack. I actually recommend that you go with the cloud approach for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it’s easier. Everything is set up for you by just clicking a few buttons, meaning that you don’t have to deal with Java versions, environment variables, and similar issues that may occur when setting things up on your local machine. Secondly, there is a difference when it comes to licenses. While Elasticsearch and Kibana is open source, some features require a license. Most of the features we will need are available with the Basic license, which is the one we get if we download Elasticsearch and Kibana. Others, however, require a license that is not free. To get around that, we can either pay for the license or activate a trial. By using Elastic Cloud, we automatically get a license where all features are available. Third, if we set things up locally, we need to do some additional configuration that is automatically done for us with Elastic Cloud. For example, when using security features such as users and roles, we need to configure this within both Elasticsearch and Kibana. I will of course show you how to do that, but it does require us to spend a bit of time within configuration files as well as the terminal. There is a free 14 day trial available for Elastic Cloud, which should be enough for you to work your way through this course. Don’t worry, you don’t have to enter any credit card information, and the trial automatically expires, so you won’t be charged anything. I have attached a link to the trial to this lecture. I am going to show you both approaches in the following lectures. Please find the lectures that are relevant to the approach that you prefer, and you can skip the other ones. Alright, let’s get started setting up Kibana!"

Shall we move on to the next lecture under Section 1: Getting Started in Kibana?

You: 

Next one is "Running Elasticsearch & Kibana in Elastic Cloud". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Let’s begin by seeing how to set up Elasticsearch and Kibana on Elastic Cloud, which is the easiest approach. Elastic Cloud is a hosted and managed solution for those who want to easily deploy an Elasticsearch cluster and avoid managing the underlying infrastructure. I have the sign up page opened up. You can find the link attached to this lecture. All we need to do is to enter our email address. The trial is free, and no credit card information is required. After the 14 days, your deployment will automatically be shut down, and you will not be charged anything. The trial should be sufficient for you to mess around with Kibana while you work your way through this course. Anyway, let’s click the button to register for the trial. Once that’s done, you will get an email asking you to verify your email address. Clicking the link within that email will lead you to this page where we should enter the password for our account. The validation rules for the password are pretty strict to be honest, which can be a bit annoying — especially if you are not using a password manager. Anyway, I will just paste in a password that passes the validation. Clicking the button will set the password and take us to the Elastic Cloud console. Note that your trial hasn’t started yet; the 14 days only begin when you create a deployment. Let’s do that now by clicking this button. The first thing we need to do when creating a deployment is to choose a pre-configured solution. These are essentially templates that use different hardware configurations based on our use case. In our case, we should choose the “Elastic Stack” solution, which is an all-purpose solution. Next, we can choose a hardware profile. Some of these are also intended for specific use cases, so let’s just go with the default one, again being an all-purpose solution. Next, we have a couple of deployment settings. Elastic Cloud deployments are hosted on a cloud provider of our choice. This is all managed on our behalf, so we don’t need an account for any of the providers. We can then choose the region in which we want our deployment to be created. For the purpose of this course, I will just leave the cloud provider and region at the default values. Lastly, we can choose which version of the Elastic Stack that we want to deploy. The most recent release is chosen by default, which is also the one you should go with. There are a couple of more options, none of which are relevant to us, so let’s give our deployment a name and create it. It doesn’t really matter what you type here. Our deployment is now being created in the background, which is going to take a few minutes. We are presented with the credentials for our Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana instance. We will need these, so be sure to save them. The username is always “elastic” and cannot be changed. If you lose the password somehow, you are able to reset it within the Elastic Cloud console. I will just grab a copy of the password myself. The “Download” button will just save the credentials as a CSV file. Anyway, the deployment is still being created, so I will be back when it’s done. Alright, our deployment has now been created, and both Elasticsearch and Kibana are ready for use! On this page, we can manage our deployment as well as find more details about it. At the bottom, for instance, we can see which instances were started up for the deployment. We won’t go into detail with that, because it’s not relevant in terms of learning Kibana. The page also includes the endpoints to Elasticsearch and Kibana, both of which we will need in this course. In a couple of lectures you will need the Elasticsearch endpoint, so this is where you can go to grab it. This is also where we launch Kibana. You can copy the endpoint for Kibana as well, but you will need to provide the password for the “elastic” user — being the credentials that popped up when we created the deployment. Clicking the “Launch” link will automatically sign us in. That’s slightly more convenient, so let’s do that. Since we don’t have any data within our Elasticsearch cluster, we are presented with this dialog when loading Kibana. Basically we have the choice of importing some test data provided by Elastic, or continuing without any data. Since we will import our own test data soon, let’s go with the latter and click the “Explore on my own” link. And there we go, everything is now ready. That was pretty easy, right? I’ll see you in the next lecture."

If you chose not to go with the Elastic Cloud setup, then this lecture is for you — assuming that you are using either macOS or Linux. If you are using Windows, please continue to the next lecture. Since Kibana uses Elasticsearch, we need to set up an Elasticsearch cluster first. So that’s where we will start. Both Elasticsearch and Kibana are just archives that need to be extracted, resulting in two directories on our file system. That’s all — there are no applications to install, files in exotic directories, or anything like that. Two self contained directories. Simple. Both Elasticsearch and Kibana have a couple of dependencies, which are shipped within the archives. For example, Elasticsearch is built with the Java programming language. Instead of requiring you to install Java on your machine, Elasticsearch ships with OpenJDK so you don’t have to do anything. Likewise, Kibana uses Node.js for its web server, which is also bundled within the archive. Alright, let’s get to business! The first thing you need to do is to download both Elasticsearch and Kibana for your platform. Choose “aarch64” if you are on an ARM based CPU or “x86” otherwise. I have attached the links to both download pages to this lecture for your convenience. I have downloaded and extracted both archives in advance. To extract the archives, simply double clicking them should do the trick. Alternatively you can use the following commands. When the archives have been extracted, open a Terminal and change your working directory to the root of the Elasticsearch directory. Use the "cd" command for that, which you are hopefully familiar with. Note that I renamed the extracted directories because their names include the platform and version. Simply adjust the directory name to match what it’s named on your file system. To start up Elasticsearch, we just need to enter a super simple command. Simply type bin/elasticsearch. This invokes a script named “elasticsearch” within the “bin” directory. That was easy, right? Elasticsearch is now starting up and performing various initialization tasks. This may take a minute or two, so I will just do a bit of time traveling. Alright, it’s the future me speaking. Elasticsearch has now fully started up and is ready for business. A couple of things were configured for us automatically, one of which is various security measures. The first one is that a superuser was created with a password, which you can see within the terminal output. You might have to scroll a bit to find it. Elasticsearch is secured with this user, so anytime we communicate with Elasticsearch, we need to provide its credentials. So go ahead and save the password, because you will need it a bit later. We can create other users with more granular permissions for improved security, but let’s go with the default security settings for now. If for some reason you lose the password — or if you forget to save it — you can always reset it with the following command. Apart from creating a superuser, TLS certificates are also generated for both internal and external communication. This means that data is encrypted when being transferred within Elasticsearch itself, and also when we communicate with Elasticsearch over HTTP. This includes Kibana, which uses Elasticsearch’s REST API under the hood. A so-called enrollment token is also created for us, which we will need for setting up Kibana. This token is essentially a way of ensuring that Kibana can communicate securely with Elasticsearch. The token is valid for 30 minutes, but a new one can be created with the following command if you need it. Alright, now that Elasticsearch is all set up, let’s turn our attention to Kibana. First, open up a new terminal window and set the working directory to the extracted Kibana directory. Before starting up Kibana, we need to take care of one thing. This is a macOS specific thing, so if you are using Linux, simply skip this step. macOS has a security mechanism called Gatekeeper, which enforces code signing and verifies downloaded applications before allowing them to run. This affects Kibana’s ability to run on macOS, so we need to disable Gatekeeper for the Kibana directory. To do that, we need to go to the parent directory and run a command. I will just type in the command. You can find it within the GitHub repository if you want to copy it. The last argument is the name of the Kibana directory, so be sure to change that if needed. Alright, that’s that. Let’s go back to the Kibana directory and start up Kibana. To do that, simply type in bin/kibana and hit Enter. After a short moment, the Kibana web server is ready on port 5601. We need to do a bit of configuration, so let’s open up the URL that is output within the terminal. This URL includes a token for security purposes, so that’s why we need to copy it. Kibana immediately prompts us to do some configuration. All we really need to do is to paste in the enrollment token that was output when starting up Elasticsearch, so let’s head back to the terminal to grab it. This token contains various information that Kibana needs to connect securely to Elasticsearch, meaning that we don’t have to configure things manually. So we just need to paste in the token and hit the button. Alright, Kibana is now done setting things up. As part of this process, it wrote a couple of things to its configuration file for us. That makes our lives much easier, and our Elastic Stack deployment more secure. Good stuff! Since our deployment is secured, we need to authenticate to proceed. We just set things up, so we only have one user, namely the “elastic” superuser. A password was generated automatically when we started up Elasticsearch, so let’s head back to the terminal to copy it. Alright, we’re in! Since we don’t have any data within our Elasticsearch cluster, we are presented with this dialog when loading Kibana. Basically we have the choice of importing some test data provided by Elastic, or continuing without any data. Since we will import our own test data soon, let’s go with the latter and click the "Explore on my own” link. That’s all it takes to set up both Elasticsearch and Kibana. If you want to shut down Elasticsearch and Kibana at some point, simply press the CTRL and C keys simultaneously within the respective terminal windows. Anyway, we are now ready to get started, so I’ll see you in the next lecture."

## 🖥️ **Self-Hosted Setup for macOS & Linux**

> If you **did not choose Elastic Cloud** and are using **macOS or Linux**, this is your local setup guide.  
> (Windows users — skip to the next lecture.)

---

### ⚙️ **What You’ll Be Setting Up**

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| 📦 **Elasticsearch** | The data store (backend) for search, logs, metrics |
| 🌐 **Kibana** | The visualization/UI layer to access that data |

No complex installation — just download, extract, and run!

---

## 📦 **1\. Download & Extract**

🎯 Go to the official download pages for both:

-   **Elasticsearch**
    
-   **Kibana**  
    👉 Choose the correct architecture:
    
-   ✅ `aarch64` → Apple Silicon or ARM CPUs
    
-   ✅ `x86` → Intel-based systems
    

📁 Extract both archives:

-   📂 You’ll get 2 self-contained directories
    
-   ⏬ Use GUI (double-click) or CLI:
    

```bash
tar -xzf elasticsearch-<version>.tar.gz
tar -xzf kibana-<version>.tar.gz
```

---

## 🧠 **2\. Elasticsearch Setup**

### 📍 Step-by-Step

1️⃣ Open a **terminal**  
2️⃣ Change to Elasticsearch directory:

```bash
cd elasticsearch-<version>/
```

3️⃣ Start Elasticsearch:

```bash
bin/elasticsearch
```

---

### 🔐 Elasticsearch Security Setup (Happens Automatically)

✔️ **Superuser created** → `elastic`  
🔑 Password → Shown in terminal (copy & save!)  
💡 If lost, reset with:

```bash
bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
```

🔒 **TLS certificates generated**:

-   Secure internal & external communication
    
-   Required by Kibana
    

📨 **Enrollment token** generated  
→ Needed for secure Kibana connection  
⚠️ Valid for 30 mins — regenerate with:

```bash
bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
```

---

## 🌐 **3\. Kibana Setup**

🆕 Open a **new terminal window**

1️⃣ Change to Kibana directory:

```bash
cd kibana-<version>/
```

---

### 🍎 macOS Only: Disable Gatekeeper

macOS blocks unverified CLI binaries.

Run this (from Kibana's parent directory):

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine kibana-<version>
```

💡 Replace `kibana-<version>` with your actual folder name.

---

### ▶️ Start Kibana

```bash
bin/kibana
```

🟢 Kibana will launch a web server on `http://localhost:5601`

---

## 🔑 **4\. Initial Configuration via Web UI**

🔗 Copy the **setup URL** from the terminal → paste in browser

🌐 Web UI prompts for:

-   **Enrollment Token** → grab it from the Elasticsearch terminal
    
-   Paste and proceed
    

📁 Kibana updates its config file automatically — no manual edits needed!

---

Ready to move on to the **next lecture** in the Kibana course?

You: 

Next one is "Activating Trial License". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Now that Kibana has been installed and set up, let’s make sure that we can access all features by activating a trial license. Although most of the features covered in this course are covered by the Basic license, there are a couple that are not. Even if we won’t use all of them, I do want to make them available and visible to give you the full picture of what Kibana can do. Note that this is only needed if you set up Elasticsearch and Kibana on your own machine. If you created a cloud deployment, you already have access to all of the features that we will need, and you are free to proceed to the next lecture. I will give you a proper introduction to the Kibana interface soon, after we set everything up. For now, let’s activate the trial license by first expanding the menu by clicking the icon at the top left corner. License management among many other things is located within the “Management” app. Specifically, under the “Stack management” menu item. This app contains a second menu where we can manage many parts of the Elastic Stack, including both Elasticsearch and Kibana. If we scroll to the bottom of the menu, we can find a menu item named “License Management.” Here we can see that we have the Basic license by default, which never expires. If we already have a license, we can upload it here. In our case, let’s start a trial by clicking the button. The dialog just shows which features we get access to with the trial. Let’s confirm by clicking the button. The Kibana interface briefly reloads, and simple as that — now we have access to all features for a month. When the trial expires, we have two options; to request an extension of the trial, or to simply revert back to the Basic license. That’s actually all; now we are ready to continue."

ChatGPT: 

Here’s a **crystal-clear explanation** of the lecture **“Activating Trial License”**, with **interactive icons, step-by-step navigation**, and key notes. This guide assumes you're running **Elasticsearch & Kibana locally** (not Elastic Cloud).

---

## 🎯 **Why Activate a Trial License?**

By default, **locally installed Kibana** runs under the **Basic license**:

| 🧾 License Type | ✅ What's Included | ⚠️ What's Missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 **Basic** | Most essential features | Advanced alerting, reporting, security (some features) |
| 🔵 **Trial** | All premium features for 30 days | Reverts to Basic after expiry |

> Even if you won’t use all advanced features, enabling the **Trial** gives you the **full Kibana experience**.

---

## ☁️ **Already Using Elastic Cloud?**

🟢 **Skip this step!**  
Elastic Cloud **already includes all features**, so you don’t need to activate a trial.

---

## 🛠️ **Step-by-Step: Activating the Trial License**

### 📍 Prerequisite: Kibana is installed & running

---

### 🧭 **1\. Open the Kibana Sidebar Menu**

📌 Click the **hamburger icon** (☰) in the **top-left corner**

This reveals the **main navigation menu**

---

### 🔧 **2\. Go to Management App**

1️⃣ Click on:

✅ Trial license is now **active for 30 days**

---

## 📅 What Happens After 30 Days?

Once the trial ends, you have **two options**:

| Option | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| 🔁 **Request an extension** | Continue using premium features longer (if approved) |
| ↩️ **Revert to Basic** | Lose access to premium features, but Kibana still works |

⚠️ No data loss — only premium feature access is restricted

---

## 📌 Final Summary (with Icons)

| Step | 🎯 Action | 💡 Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | ☰ Open sidebar menu | Top-left corner of Kibana |

Ready to explore the **Kibana interface** next? Let’s move to the next lecture!

You: 

Next one is "Console Tool". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "In this lecture we are going to explore an incredibly useful development tool named Console. There is a fair chance that you are already familiar with it. If that’s the case, feel free to skip this lecture, as I probably won’t cover anything you don’t already know. The Console tool lets us send queries to our Elasticsearch cluster using a convenient syntax that is much easier than sending requests with cURL, for instance. It helps us in a number of ways, including JSON formatting, auto-completion, etc. Let’s see what it looks like. The tool is located within the “Dev Tools” app, so let’s open that up. To the left is an editor where we write queries, while query results appear to the right. As you can see, an example query has already been added to the editor. Let’s type out our own query, though - one that returns the health of our Elasticsearch cluster. First, we enter the HTTP verb for the request, which is GET for the API that we are going to use. Following the HTTP verb is the request path. We will use the Cluster health API, so I will type out of the path for this API. Notice how Kibana helped me type that out with auto-completion, which is quite convenient. Also notice how the leading forward slash within the request path is optional. If we don’t add it, Kibana will do so for us automatically. I like to include it, but that’s just a matter of preference. To run the query, simply click the small triangle to the right. The results are displayed as a pretty formatted JSON object to the right. Most Elasticsearch APIs require a request body containing parameters, so let me show you an example of that. I will just quickly type out the simplest possible search query, being the match\_all query. As you can see, we simply add the request body below the HTTP verb and request path. This is how you will structure most requests within the Console tool. Let’s run this query as well. We can then see the search results to the right. The queries we enter are saved to local storage, so you can leave the tool without having to manually save them. Kibana will also keep a history of the queries that you have run, which can be convenient sometimes. Perhaps you noticed that the example query contains variables. We can define custom variables and use those with the shown syntax within our queries. This can sometimes be convenient if you feel like you are repeating the same thing over and over again, such as an index name for instance. Alright, that’s the Console tool. It’s basically just a convenient tool for quickly running queries against your Elasticsearch cluster. It’s easier and faster to work with than having to type out cURL commands, handle authentication, etc. It’s typically used during development when writing new queries, after which they can easily be ported to wherever they need to be run in production. Another use of the tool is for debugging things, whether that’s production queries or the Elasticsearch cluster. We won’t be using the tool much in this course, because it’s really a tool for interacting with Elasticsearch. Either way, now you know how it works, and actually we will use it in the next lecture to add a few index templates."

### 🎉 That’s the Console Tool!

It's your **quick-access terminal** to the Elasticsearch API — great for testing, debugging, and iterating.

🧭 Up next: You’ll use this tool to create **index templates**.

Shall we continue?

You: 

Next one is "Adding Index Templates". Replace "&nbsp;" with " " in the transcript.Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Now that Kibana has been set up, we are almost ready to import some test data. We just need to do one thing&nbsp; first; add two index templates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Index templates are a way of automatically&nbsp; applying index settings and mappings when&nbsp;&nbsp; a new Elasticsearch index is created — provided&nbsp; that its name matches a pattern that we define.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the example that you see on your screen now,&nbsp; a new index is created as the result of a query.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is an index template with a&nbsp; pattern that matches the name of the index,&nbsp;&nbsp; the mappings and settings provided&nbsp; by the index template are applied. We will use index templates to ensure that our&nbsp; documents are mapped and indexed according to&nbsp;&nbsp; the Elastic Common Schema — at least in the case&nbsp; of our access logs dataset. In case you don’t know&nbsp;&nbsp; what ECS is, it’s essentially a specification that&nbsp; defines field names and how they should be mapped. Let me quickly show you an example. Suppose&nbsp; that we are ingesting HTTP access logs into&nbsp;&nbsp; Elasticsearch, either from nginx or the Apache web&nbsp; server. Before ECS came around, different field&nbsp;&nbsp; names were used depending on which web server&nbsp; was used. This was inconvenient because it meant&nbsp;&nbsp; that we had to be aware of which web server was&nbsp; used when working with the data within Kibana.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we were to change the web server, we&nbsp; would have to reindex all of our access&nbsp;&nbsp; logs as well as reconfigure a number of&nbsp; things within Kibana. Not so convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, ECS was introduced with specifications&nbsp; for field names and mappings for common fields.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, the URL of an HTTP request is the&nbsp; same regardless of which web server is used.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore it makes sense to use the same&nbsp; field name and mapping for all web servers. The same concept applies to other&nbsp; technologies that are similar.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ECS specification also includes fields that&nbsp; are common across all technologies. For instance,&nbsp;&nbsp; the time of an event is something all events&nbsp; should have, and therefore we can make things&nbsp;&nbsp; easier for ourselves by always naming the field&nbsp; the same. In ECS, that field is named @timestamp,&nbsp;&nbsp; which you will also see when we take a look at the&nbsp; test data that we will be using for this course. Alright, enough about the Elastic Common&nbsp; Schema. While ECS is mostly important to&nbsp;&nbsp; know when indexing documents into Elasticsearch,&nbsp; it is also used within Kibana. Now you know what&nbsp;&nbsp; it is in case you see it somewhere. If you&nbsp; are not familiar with index templates or ECS,&nbsp;&nbsp; then you don’t have to worry about it at all.&nbsp; Simply follow along and you will be all set;&nbsp;&nbsp; once the index templates have been added,&nbsp; everything else will happen automatically. Since the queries to add the&nbsp; index templates are quite large,&nbsp;&nbsp; I will copy them from a GitHub repository that I&nbsp; created for this course. You can find the link to&nbsp;&nbsp; the repository attached to this lecture. Let’s&nbsp; begin with the one for the access logs dataset. Now we could send the query to Elasticsearch&nbsp; through an HTTP client of our choice,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the easiest way is to use Kibana. The query&nbsp; that I copied is formatted to be compatible with&nbsp;&nbsp; Kibana’s Console tool, which we introduced&nbsp; in the previous lecture. Let’s open it up. Let’s paste in the query&nbsp; that we copied a moment ago. The index template matches indices beginning with&nbsp; “access-logs,” and anything&nbsp;&nbsp; thereafter. In place of the wildcard,&nbsp; the index names will contain a date.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a lot of access logs, it might make&nbsp; sense to create one index per day. In our case,&nbsp;&nbsp; we will create one index per month since&nbsp; that is sufficient for the amount of data&nbsp;&nbsp; that we are dealing with in this course. Both&nbsp; formats match the index template, though.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see examples of both on your screen.&nbsp; Anyway, let’s go ahead and run the query. Great! That’s it for the access logs dataset.&nbsp; Let’s do the same thing for the orders dataset. And head back over to Kibana. Let’s run this query as well. That’s it. Now that the index&nbsp; templates have been added,&nbsp;&nbsp; we are ready to index some test&nbsp; data into our Elasticsearch cluster."

## 🧩 **What Are Index Templates?**

📦 **Index templates** are a way to:

-   **Predefine settings & mappings** for indices
    
-   Automatically apply those configurations when a **new index is created**, **if the index name matches a pattern**
    

---

### 📌 **Why Use Index Templates?**

| 🔧 Purpose | 💡 Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| 🛠️ Auto-configure new indices | No need to define settings/mappings manually |
| 🎯 Enforce naming patterns | Applies only when index names match a specific pattern |
| 📊 Ensure data consistency | Useful for log indexing, dashboards, ECS compliance |

---

## 📚 **What is ECS (Elastic Common Schema)?**

> 🧠 ECS is a **field-naming and mapping standard** used across all Elastic Stack tools.

### 🌐 Why is ECS important?

| 🧾 Problem Before ECS | ✅ Solution With ECS |
| --- | --- |
| Apache logs had different fields than Nginx logs | ECS unifies the field names |
| Changing data sources required reindexing | ECS avoids reconfiguration hassle |
| Custom dashboards would break | ECS keeps dashboards compatible |

🔁 Example:  
Instead of `http.url` (Apache) vs `nginx_url` (Nginx), ECS just uses → `url.full`

🕒 Common field: `@timestamp` → unified across all logs & events

---

## 🛠️ **Our Goal in This Lecture**

🎯 Add **2 index templates** via **Kibana Console Tool**:

1.  Access Logs Index Template → matches `access-logs*`
    
2.  Orders Index Template → matches `orders*`
    

---

## 🧪 **Step-by-Step: Adding Index Templates in Console**

### 🧭 1. Open **Console Tool**

```text
Kibana → Dev Tools → Console
```

---

### 📋 2. Copy Pre-Written Template Query

📁 Templates are available from the course’s **GitHub repository** (link provided in lecture)

➡️ The queries are already formatted for Kibana Console

---

### 🔍 3. Access Logs Template

**Example pattern:**

```json
PUT _index_template/access-logs-template
{
  "index_patterns": ["access-logs-*"],
  "template": {
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "@timestamp": { "type": "date" },
        "url": { "type": "keyword" },
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

📆 The index might look like:

-   `access-logs-2025.08.01` (daily)
    
-   `access-logs-2025.08` (monthly — used in this course)
    

▶️ Click the **"Play/Run"** button to send the request

✅ Success response confirms template is created

---

### 📋 4. Orders Dataset Template

📁 Go back to GitHub → copy the second template

📄 Paste into Console → hit **Run**

🎯 Matches index names like:

-   `orders-2025.08`

🎉 **That’s it!** Index templates are now in place.

You're ready to **import test data** into your Elasticsearch cluster in the next lecture.

Shall we move on?

You: 

Next one is "Importing Test Data". Replace "&nbsp;" with " " in the transcript. Transcript is nearly 9 minutes. No part of the transcript has to be skipped and no excuses. Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Kibana is not much fun without any data, so&nbsp; let’s add some. I have prepared two datasets&nbsp;&nbsp; for this course, which we will take a&nbsp; closer look at in the next lecture. The&nbsp;&nbsp; files containing the data are formatted to&nbsp; be compatible with Elasticsearch’s Bulk API,&nbsp;&nbsp; which you may be familiar with. We will be using&nbsp; the Bulk API through cURL. In case you are not&nbsp;&nbsp; familiar with cURL, it’s the most popular command&nbsp; line HTTP client. In fact, it’s preinstalled on&nbsp;&nbsp; most operating systems. I say “most” because&nbsp; it wasn’t installed on Windows by default prior&nbsp;&nbsp; to version 10. If it’s not available on your&nbsp; Windows installation, you can find a download&nbsp;&nbsp; link attached to this lecture. If you are on macOS&nbsp; or any Linux distribution, you should be all set. Alright, so you can find the test&nbsp; data within the GitHub repository,&nbsp;&nbsp; which I have opened up here. The link&nbsp; to the repository is attached to this&nbsp;lecture. To download the data,&nbsp; first click on the file name. And then click the download button to the right. The zip archive contains four files;&nbsp; one for the orders dataset and three&nbsp;&nbsp; for the access logs dataset.&nbsp; The latter covers three months,&nbsp;&nbsp; being January through March of 2020.&nbsp; Let’s extract the downloaded archive. Double-clicking the file should work on&nbsp; all operating systems as far as I know. Now that the archive has been extracted,&nbsp; let’s head over to the terminal to ingest&nbsp;&nbsp; it into Elasticsearch with cURL,&nbsp; beginning with the orders dataset. If you are using Windows, then you&nbsp; should open the Command Prompt instead. The working directory should be the directory&nbsp; in which the extracted files are placed. In case you are new to the terminal, you&nbsp; should use the “cd” command for this.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can find the commands shown in this&nbsp; lecture within the GitHub repository. Alright, so naturally the&nbsp; command begins with “curl.” Elasticsearch clusters are set up to encrypt&nbsp; network traffic with TLS by default. If your Elasticsearch cluster is running on your&nbsp; local machine, we need to handle this,&nbsp;&nbsp; since the cluster uses a self signed certificate&nbsp; that HTTP clients do not trust by default. If you are using a cloud deployment, then you&nbsp; don’t need to do anything in this regard. We have two choices; instructing cURL to&nbsp; blindly trust the certificate and ignore&nbsp;&nbsp; that it’s a self signed one, or to provide&nbsp; a CA certificate. For the first approach,&nbsp;&nbsp; we can simply add -k to the command and we are&nbsp; all done. As for the second option, we can use&nbsp;&nbsp; the cacert option to specify a path to the CA&nbsp; certificate that is generated by Elasticsearch.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see the path to it on the diagram,&nbsp; relative to the Elasticsearch root directory. So which approach should you go&nbsp; with, then? Technically speaking,&nbsp;&nbsp; providing a CA certificate is the&nbsp; most correct thing to do. However,&nbsp;&nbsp; since we are just working with a development&nbsp; cluster, instructing cURL to trust the self&nbsp;&nbsp; signed certificate is completely fine. As&nbsp; long as you don’t do this for production&nbsp;&nbsp; clusters or cloud deployments, that is. So&nbsp; that’s also the approach that I will go with. To communicate with our Elasticsearch cluster,&nbsp;&nbsp; we need to authenticate our requests. That’s&nbsp; done by specifying a username and password.&nbsp;&nbsp; The credentials are output within the&nbsp; terminal the first time you start up&nbsp;Elasticsearch. For cloud deployments, they&nbsp; are provided during the setup process. With cURL, we can specify the credentials&nbsp; with the -u option as follows. I only specify the username here, because it’s&nbsp; generally not recommended to add passwords to&nbsp;commands. When running the command, I will&nbsp; be prompted to enter the password before&nbsp;&nbsp; the request is sent. If you prefer, you can&nbsp; append a colon followed by your password,&nbsp;&nbsp; in which case you will not be prompted&nbsp; for the password when running the command. Next, we need to specify the Content-Type header,&nbsp;&nbsp; which we can do with the -H argument. This&nbsp; header should specify the NDJSON content&nbsp;&nbsp; type so that Elasticsearch knows which type&nbsp; of data it’s receiving. Let’s type that out. Then we need to specify the HTTP verb.&nbsp; If we leave it out, it defaults to GET,&nbsp;&nbsp; but we need it to be POST. We use&nbsp; the -X argument to specify the verb. Next, we should enter the URL to our&nbsp; Elasticsearch cluster, and the Bulk API&nbsp;in particular. Since I am working with a local&nbsp; Elasticsearch cluster, that will be localhost&nbsp;&nbsp; on port 9200. In the case of Elastic Cloud,&nbsp; you need to grab your deployment’s endpoint&nbsp;&nbsp; and use that instead. Remember to append&nbsp; the path to the Bulk API to the endpoint. Notice how I didn’t specify any index name&nbsp; within the endpoint. That’s because the&nbsp;&nbsp; bulk files actually contain the name of the&nbsp; index that documents should be indexed into,&nbsp;&nbsp; and so we don’t need to specify&nbsp; this within the endpoint. Finally, we need to actually send some&nbsp; data along with the POST request. We do&nbsp;&nbsp; that with the data-binary argument.&nbsp; Notice that this argument must be&nbsp;&nbsp; prepended with two hyphens instead of just one. We then add the file name within&nbsp; double quotes, prepended with an&nbsp;@ symbol. This symbol tells cURL that&nbsp; the value is a file name and not a path. We send the file content along as binary&nbsp; data, because we want to preserve the newline&nbsp;&nbsp; characters. Other cURL arguments process&nbsp; the data, causing newlines to be removed. That’s it! Let’s run the command. After a short moment, Elasticsearch&nbsp; responds with information about the&nbsp;&nbsp; operations contained within the bulk file.&nbsp; We can inspect the results if we want to,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the data should have been ingested&nbsp; correctly. I will just trust this blindly,&nbsp;&nbsp; because if there was an issue, we&nbsp; are going to find out soon anyway. Let’s repeat this process for the access&nbsp; logs dataset consisting of three files.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can simply hit the arrow up key to&nbsp; get back the command that we just ran. All we need to do is to change&nbsp; the file name within the command,&nbsp;&nbsp; first for the file containing&nbsp; access logs for January 2020. Then simply hit the Enter key to run the command. Let’s repeat this process for the two remaining&nbsp; files and simply increase the month number by one. There we go! All of the test&nbsp; data has now been ingested,&nbsp;&nbsp; meaning that we have some data&nbsp; to work with within Kibana."

## 📦 **Why Import Test Data into Kibana?**

> 🔍 Kibana is not useful without data.  
> To explore visualizations and dashboards, you first need **real datasets in Elasticsearch**.

In this lecture, you’ll learn how to:

✅ Import two datasets into Elasticsearch  
🧪 Use the **Bulk API**  
🖥 Use **cURL** from the terminal (Command Prompt on Windows)

---

## 📁 **Test Datasets Used**

| Dataset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 📦 `orders.json` | E-commerce style order data |
| 🌐 `access-logs-*.json` | Web server logs (Jan–Mar 2020) |

These files are packaged in a **zip file** from the course’s **GitHub repository** (link in the lecture).

---

## 🪜 **Step-by-Step Data Import Process**

---

### 📥 **1\. Download Test Data**

🔗 Go to GitHub → Click file → Click **Download**  
🗜️ Extract the ZIP archive → You’ll get **4 files**:

-   `orders.json`
    
-   `access-logs-2020-01.json`
    
-   `access-logs-2020-02.json`
    
-   `access-logs-2020-03.json`
    

📁 Place them in an easy-to-access folder

---

### 💻 **2\. Open Terminal**

| Platform | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| 🪟 Windows | **Command Prompt (CMD)** |
| 🍎 macOS | Terminal (preinstalled) |
| 🐧 Linux | Terminal (preinstalled) |

Use `cd` to navigate to the folder where files are extracted:

```bash
cd path/to/downloaded/files
```

---

### 🔧 **3\. About the Bulk API**

🧠 **Bulk API** lets you send **many documents** in one request (optimized for batch imports)

Each test file is pre-formatted for Bulk API compatibility using **NDJSON** (Newline Delimited JSON)

---

### 🌐 **4\. Use cURL to Import**

#### 🧰 What is cURL?

A **command-line HTTP client** used to send HTTP requests.

-   ✅ Preinstalled on macOS/Linux
    
-   ⚠️ Windows 10+ comes with cURL; for older versions, download from curl.se
    

---

## 🔐 **5\. Handle HTTPS (TLS Certificates)**

Elasticsearch uses HTTPS by default with **self-signed certificates**.  
This causes issues unless handled:

| Option | Command Add-on | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 😎 Trust blindly | `-k` | For development (recommended here) |
| 🔐 Securely trust | `--cacert /path/to/ca.crt` | For production setups |

👉 We’ll use:

```bash
-k
```

---

## 🔑 **6\. Add Authentication**

All requests must be authenticated with the superuser credentials:

```bash
-u elastic
```

> It will prompt you for a password securely.

You may also hardcode password (not recommended):

```bash
-u elastic:yourpassword
```

---

## 📋 **7\. Specify Headers and Request Details**

Here’s what the full cURL command includes:

```bash
curl -k -u elastic \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" \
-X POST "https://localhost:9200/_bulk" \
--data-binary "@orders.json"
```

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `-k` | Skip certificate validation |
| `-u` | Add username (and optional password) |
| `-H` | Set content type to `application/x-ndjson` |
| `-X POST` | Set HTTP verb to POST |
| URL | Target Bulk API endpoint |
| `--data-binary` | Send raw file contents (preserve newline characters) |
| `"@filename"` | Reference the actual file to send |

⚠️ No index name is provided in URL because each file contains its own `_index` metadata.

---

### ▶️ **8\. Run the Command for Orders Data**

```bash
curl -k -u elastic \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" \
-X POST "https://localhost:9200/_bulk" \
--data-binary "@orders.json"
```

🕒 Elasticsearch responds with the result of each bulk operation.  
You can **inspect the response** or move on.

---

## 🔁 **9\. Import Access Logs (3 Months)**

Repeat the same command, updating only the file name:

### 📁 January:

```bash
--data-binary "@access-logs-2020-01.json"
```

### 📁 February:

```bash
--data-binary "@access-logs-2020-02.json"
```

### 📁 March:

```bash
--data-binary "@access-logs-2020-03.json"
```

💡 Use your terminal’s **Up Arrow** to reuse the previous command and change the filename.

---

## ✅ **10\. You Now Have Data in Elasticsearch!**

🎉 You've successfully indexed:

-   Orders dataset
    
-   Access logs for 3 months
    

You’re now ready to:

You're now ready to **use this test data inside Kibana**!  
Shall we go to the **next lecture**?

You: 

Next one is "Introduction to the test data". Replace "&nbsp;" with " " in the transcript. Transcript is nearly 10 minutes. No part of the transcript has to be skipped and no excuses. Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Now that we have ingested our test data into Elasticsearch, let’s take a short moment to talk about it. You already know that we will be working with two different datasets; one containing HTTP access logs, and one containing orders. Let’s begin by talking about the former. The HTTP access logs originate from nginx, which is commonly used to process HTTP requests. The actual HTTP requests are the same whether we use nginx, Apache, or any other web server. That’s why the structure of our Elasticsearch documents are independent of which web server the requests were served by. Hopefully you remember me mentioning the Elastic Common Schema (abbreviated ECS) when we added our two index templates. The one for the access logs dataset specified field mappings that were compatible with ECS. That’s the same structure as you can see within the example document that you see on your screen now. To be clear, although you see two JSON objects, they actually represent the same document; I just had to split it up to fit it on the screen. Let’s just quickly run through the various fields to give you an idea of which data we have to work with. First and foremost, we have the @timestamp field. This field contains the time of the event, which is the time of when the HTTP request was received in this case. The http field contains information about the request, such as the request method, referrer, status code, etc. The client object contains the IP address of the client that sent the HTTP request, as well as geographical information. This information was resolved by using the MaxMind GeoLite2 database. Geolocation is inherently not super precise — at least not when using free datasets — but it’s good enough in this case. Some of the documents contain more fields than these, because some cannot be resolved every time. In case you are wondering why the client’s IP address is duplicated within two different fields, this is a result of a technicality within the ECS specification. The client.address field contains the client address which may be an IP address, a domain, or perhaps even a UNIX socket. The client.ip field specifically contains IP addresses in the cases where the address resolves to an IP address. If the address were a domain, a field named client.domain would be present alongside the client.address field. That’s not the case for any of our documents, though. Anyway, let’s move on to the next field, being the message field. This field contains the raw event from which all of the other fields were extracted. This is the line that was read from within the access log file. Since web servers use different logging formats, the value within this field is specific to the nginx web server. The reason for keeping this value around after processing the request, is basically just for backup purposes. If we discover an issue with how we processed requests, we are able to use this field to process all requests again after fixing the issue. The dataset field specifies the source of the event, which is an nginx access log in this case. If we were ingesting error logs, this could have been “nginx.error” instead, for example. The url object contains information about the URL that the HTTP request was sent to, such as the URL path. Although our dataset doesn’t contain these fields, a couple of other examples include the hash fragment, query parameters, domain, port, scheme, etc. The difference between the path and original fields is that the original field contains the unmodified URL which may include the aforementioned things, such as query parameters. The path field, on the other hand, only includes the URL path. Again, this is just an ECS technicality. The user\_agent object unsurprisingly contains information about the client’s user agent. That’s typically a browser but could also be HTTP clients such as Postman or cURL. This includes a name, version, and the name of the device, as well as information about the operating system. The original user agent is stored as well, exactly as you saw with some of the other fields. Last but not least, we have a field named hour\_of\_day. This is a custom field, and so there is no mention of it within the ECS specification. I don’t want to get into the reason for adding this field right now, because we will get back to it later in the course — particularly when talking about heat maps. Instead, let’s talk about the other dataset, being for orders. This dataset also contains an @timestamp field, being the only use of the ECS specification. This is just a good standard to use for the timestamp field, but it’s of course not a requirement. Each order naturally has an ID, so no big surprise there. The channel field may be either online or offline, representing where the order was placed. This particular order was placed in a physical store, which is why a store field is also present. This field naturally doesn’t exist for orders placed online. Next up, we have a product object which contains various information about the product that was purchased. Perhaps you are wondering why an order may only contain a single product. There’s a good reason for that. Well, technically multiple products can be defined within an array because every Elasticsearch field may contain zero or more values. The reason I haven’t done it in this way is that we would need to map this as a nested field within Elasticsearch. Otherwise we wouldn’t be able to query products independently. That’s easy, but the problem is that Kibana doesn’t support nested fields for the most part. It’s something that a lot of people have requested — including myself — but it’s still a work in progress. If we were to include multiple products and run aggregations on the products, they would then yield incorrect results in some scenarios. This is honestly pretty inconvenient because the concept of order lines is extremely common. And, you might already have stored orders with order lines within Elasticsearch. We might not have the option to structure our documents in a specific way due to a Kibana limitation. To be clear, it’s certainly possible to make use of nested fields; we would just be limited in which aggregations we can use within visualizations. In this course I just chose to work my way around the issue because then I am able to show you some things that I otherwise wouldn’t be able to. My apologies if that got a bit confusing. The point is that an order may only include a single product due to a Kibana limitation related to the nested datatype. That’s really the takeaway, so you don’t need to understand the specifics if you are not familiar with that datatype. In case you are curious, I have attached a link to the related GitHub issue. Moving on, we have a discount field. A discount is not always given, so this field does not exist for all documents. The total field then contains the product’s price minus any discount. The salesman object specifies which salesman drove the sale. This object is only available for physical sales, i.e. when the channel field equals offline. Last but not least, we have an object containing information about the customer who purchased the product. As you will see later, we can use this data to perform simple analysis on the customer demographics. And that’s the data that we will be working with in this course. If you want to have a look at how this is mapped in Elasticsearch, then you can check out the index templates that we added. These contain the field mappings that were used when creating our indices. The mappings were automatically applied when ingesting the test data in the previous lecture."

Here's a **crystal-clear explanation** of the lecture **“Introduction to the Test Data”**, with all `&nbsp;` replaced by normal spaces, and enriched with **interactive icons**, structured examples, and real-world relevance. This is a complete breakdown with no skipped content.

---

## 🧪 **What’s in the Test Data?**

We’re working with **two datasets**:

1.  🌐 **Access Logs** (from the `nginx` web server)
    
2.  🛒 **Orders** (from an e-commerce-like domain)
    

These datasets were **imported into Elasticsearch** using the **Bulk API** in the last lecture.

Let’s understand what data fields are available and how they're structured — especially important as we begin creating visualizations in Kibana.

---

## 🌐 **1\. Access Logs Dataset (Web Server Data)**

### 🧾 Source

-   Originates from **nginx** (commonly used web server)
    
-   Structured using **ECS**: Elastic Common Schema
    

> ✅ ECS helps **standardize field names** across technologies, making data portable and dashboards reusable.

---

### 🔍 Example Fields (Per Log Document)

| 🏷️ Field | 📌 Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🕒 `@timestamp` | Time when the HTTP request was received |
| 🌐 `http` | Contains request info (method, referrer, status code) |
| 🧍 `client` | IP, location (via MaxMind GeoLite2) |
| 🗨️ `message` | Raw log line from the nginx access log |
| 📄 `dataset` | Source of the event, e.g., `nginx.access` |
| 🔗 `url` | URL path, original URL (may include query params, etc.) |
| 🌐 `user_agent` | Info about client’s browser/device or HTTP client |
| 🕰️ `hour_of_day` | Custom field used for time-based analysis (like heatmaps) |

---

### 📘 **ECS Clarifications**

-   🔄 `client.address` vs `client.ip`:
    
    -   `address` could be an IP, domain, or socket
        
    -   `ip` is **only** for IP addresses
        
-   🔁 `url.path` vs `url.original`:
    
    -   `path` → just the route (e.g., `/products`)
        
    -   `original` → full URL (e.g., `/products?id=123`)
        
-   🧪 `user_agent.original` is preserved for backup, along with parsed details like:
    
    -   Browser name/version
        
    -   OS and device type
        

---

## 🧭 **Purpose of `message` Field**

This holds the **raw log line**, used for:

-   **Backup**
    
-   **Reprocessing** (if parsing issues are found)
    

💡 Keeping raw data is helpful in observability pipelines

---

### 🛠️ Custom Field: `hour_of_day`

⏱️ Not part of ECS. It’s custom-created to enable:

-   **Heatmap visualizations**
    
-   **Time-based usage patterns**
    

We’ll revisit this when we explore heatmaps in Kibana.

---

## 🛍️ **2\. Orders Dataset**

Unlike access logs, the **orders dataset** only partially uses ECS — namely for the `@timestamp` field.

This dataset is more business-focused.

---

### 🔍 Example Fields (Per Order Document)

| 🏷️ Field | 📌 Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🕒 `@timestamp` | When the order was placed |
| 🔢 `id` | Order ID |
| 🛒 `channel` | `"online"` or `"offline"` |
| 🏬 `store` | Present only if `channel = offline` |
| 📦 `product` | Product details (type, category, price) |
| 💸 `discount` | Optional, only present if discount is applied |
| 💰 `total` | Final price (after discount) |
| 👤 `salesman` | Present only for offline sales |
| 👥 `customer` | Info about buyer (name, country, age, etc.) |

---

### ❓ Why One Product per Order?

Technically, **Elasticsearch supports arrays**, so one order **could** have multiple products.

BUT…  
🛑 **Kibana doesn’t fully support nested fields**  
→ Makes aggregations **inaccurate or limited**

💡 Therefore:

-   Each document contains **only one product**
    
-   This simplifies visualization building in Kibana
    

📌 More info: A link to the relevant [GitHub issue](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues) is attached in the course

---

### 🔍 Examples of Field Availability

| Field | Present When… |
| --- | --- |
| `store` | Only if order is **offline** |
| `salesman` | Only for **physical (offline)** sales |
| `discount` | Only if a discount was applied |

---

## 📈 **Why These Datasets Matter**

-   ✅ **Access logs** help us explore observability, client behavior, geolocation, time-based traffic, etc.
    
-   ✅ **Orders data** lets us analyze customer behavior, sales channels, store performance, and product trends.
    

---

## 📋 Where to View Mappings?

You can inspect all field mappings in:

```text
Kibana → Stack Management → Index Management → Templates
```

🗂️ We added index templates earlier → those mappings were **automatically applied** when test data was imported.

---

## 📌 Summary Table

| Dataset | Field Examples | ECS Compliance | Notable Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🌐 Access Logs | `@timestamp`, `http`, `client`, `url`, `message`, `user_agent`, `hour_of_day` | ✅ Yes (fully) | Uses MaxMind geo-IP, ECS standard, custom field |
| 🛒 Orders | `@timestamp`, `id`, `channel`, `store`, `product`, `discount`, `total`, `salesman`, `customer` | ⚠️ Partial (`@timestamp` only) | Only one product per order due to Kibana nested field limitations |

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

-   📊 ECS makes it easier to build consistent visualizations
    
-   🧩 Index templates apply mappings automatically
    
-   🧠 Understanding data structure helps you ask better questions and build smarter dashboards
    
-   🔍 Certain fields (like `salesman`, `discount`, `store`) are **conditionally available**

You're now ready to start **exploring and visualizing this data in Kibana**!  
Shall we move on to the next lecture?

You: 

Next one is "Creating Data Views". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Alright, just one thing left to do before we can really get started; to create data views. But first, let’s talk about what a data view is in the first place. Kibana retrieves the data it displays from Elasticsearch indices, whether it’s for visualizations, dashboards, or queries. That’s all done by using Elasticsearch’s REST API. Nothing new here. Let me illustrate how data views work in the context of our test data. We have an index named "orders" which stores all of our order data. Now we want to create a number of Kibana visualizations for this index. This could be a line or bar chart showing the number of orders over time, and a pie chart showing the most popular products. For each of the visualizations, we need to tell Kibana from which Elasticsearch indices it should retrieve the data. This is exactly what a data view does. A data view specifies an index pattern, which matches one or more indices. Let’s look at two examples of data views for two different use cases. Our orders data set was indexed into a single index named “orders”. When we create a data view for this data set, we can therefore simply enter that as the index pattern. Although we only have a single index containing orders, we might as well add a wildcard at the end, just in case we need to split the orders data into multiple indices in the future. This causes the data view to match data in all Elasticsearch indices that begin with "orders". If we change our indexing strategy in the future, we won’t need to modify our Kibana data view to reflect this; any visualizations or dashboards associated with this data view will automatically retrieve data from all matching indices. This would be the case for our access logs data set. Specifically, we have three indices storing the access logs — one index per month. That’s because we are running a busy website, and so storing all of the access logs within a single index does not scale well enough. This approach is quite common with the Elastic Stack. As long as the index names use some kind of naming scheme, we can define an index pattern with a wildcard that matches all of them. In this case we have the year and month number at the end of the index names, so that’s the part we need to match with a wildcard. With the data view that you see on your screen now, we can match our three indices and any that might be added later. When we create a visualization based on this data view, Kibana will construct Elasticsearch queries that search through all indices matching its index pattern. Using wildcards in index patterns is therefore a way of dealing with data that is divided into multiple indices. This enables us to work with the data as if it came from a single index, even though several indices are queried within Elasticsearch. Pretty cool, right? A data view is actually required before we can interact with our data within Kibana, so let’s create one. We will need to create a data view for each of our two datasets. Let’s begin with the access logs dataset. First, click the "Stack Management" menu item within the "Management" group. Then find the "Kibana" group in the secondary menu, under which we click "Data Views". Then click the “Create data view” button to get started. I'll begin by creating a data view for our access logs, so I will name it "Access logs". Next up, we need to define an index pattern. I will just use the one I showed you on the diagram a moment ago. As you can see to the right, this pattern matches all of our three indices. To make using our data view smooth and easy, we can configure a timestamp field. Kibana will then use this field automatically for filtering our data by time. The correct field has already been chosen for us, so we don’t need to do anything. That’s all we need to do, so let’s create the data view. The data view has now been created. Kibana has inspected the field mappings of the matching indices, which you can see within the table. Let’s finish up by creating a data view for our orders dataset as well. Let’s name this one “Orders”. Even though we only have one index for this dataset, I will still include a wildcard in the index pattern. That’s it! We now have a data view for each of our datasets. Everything is now set up, and we are ready to get started with Kibana."

Here's a **crystal-clear explanation** of the lecture **“Creating Data Views”** in Kibana — structured with **interactive icons**, simplified visuals, and no skipped content.

## 🧭 **What is a Data View in Kibana?**

> A **Data View** in Kibana tells Kibana **which Elasticsearch indices** to query when building:

-   📊 Visualizations
    
-   📈 Dashboards
    
-   🔎 Search or filters
    

📌 **You must create a data view** before using any Kibana features that visualize or explore data.

---

## 🔍 **How Data Views Work**

Imagine we have two datasets in Elasticsearch:

| Dataset | Index Name(s) |
| --- | --- |
| 🛍️ Orders | `orders` |
| 🌐 Access Logs | `access-logs-2020-01`, `access-logs-2020-02`, `access-logs-2020-03` |

➡️ Instead of referencing each index manually, we use a **wildcard pattern** in the data view.

---

### 📌 Index Pattern Examples

| Data View Name | Index Pattern | Matches... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Orders` | `orders*` | All indices starting with "orders" |
| `Access logs` | `access-logs-*` | All access log indices, past & future |

---

## 🎯 **Why Use Wildcards in Index Patterns?**

| ⚠️ Without Wildcard | ✅ With Wildcard |
| --- | --- |
| Hardcoded to one index | Auto-matches future indices |
| Needs updates when structure changes | Works long-term |

> 🔁 Even if you have **only one index now**, wildcards future-proof your data views.

---

## 🪜 **How to Create a Data View in Kibana**
