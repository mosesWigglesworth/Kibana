Let‚Äôs begin! üöÄ

You: 

First one will be "Overview of Apps". This transcript is 16 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "In this section, I am going to introduce you to the Kibana interface. This will give us a nice foundation before going more in depth with specific parts of Kibana in the following sections. What I want to talk about in this lecture is apps. Kibana consists of a number of apps, similar to what you see on a smartphone or tablet. Even the start page is an app. Within the Kibana interface, the apps are listed on the left-hand side, being the menu. The apps are grouped into logical categories. We won‚Äôt cover all of the apps in this course because a number of them are use case specific. These use cases are referred to as solutions and include observability and security analysis, for instance. This requires setup of a number of tools, including the Elastic Agent. I won‚Äôt cover these solutions in this course because they utilize the whole Elastic Stack, and they are therefore not specific to Kibana. That being said, I will briefly go through all of the apps and explain their purpose. Just a quick note before we get into it. The apps that I am about to mention change quite frequently and pretty much with every release of Kibana. Not that the apps themselves change much, but rather how they are named and organized. I will do my best to keep everything up to date, but please keep in mind that this is really a moving target. For a bit of context, there were three significant changes to this while making this course. So if you see something that looks different, I will update it as soon as possible. Let‚Äôs begin with the apps within the Kibana category, which are the ones we will be spending most of our time on. First, we have the Discover app. Consider this a playground for running ad hoc queries against your data. Perhaps you want to filter documents based on certain criteria and display the results in a pretty interface. As you will see in a couple of lectures, the Discover app provides a lot of convenient shortcuts, making it much faster to use than writing entire queries manually. You can easily click to apply filters, inspect matching documents, etc. The Visualize app is where we build and manage visualizations, such as pie charts, line charts, and many more. We will explore this app in detail once we get to working with visualizations. The Dashboard app is where we build, manage, and display dashboards. A dashboard is an orchestration of visualizations, so we could build a dashboard consisting of pie charts, line charts, and tables, for instance. Basically anything we build using the Visualize app. It‚Äôs common to have multiple dashboards with each of their focus or scope. For instance, we could have a dashboard showing information about HTTP access logs and another that shows hardware utilization of servers. You could also have a non-technical dashboard that displays data for a sales team or management. Dashboards are therefore a great way of presenting data in an easily digestible format, perhaps for different groups of people. The Canvas app is basically dashboards on steroids. Canvas gives you much more control over the visualization and presentation of your data than dashboards do. Dashboards are focused on presenting a limited number of visualizations with simple styling options. Canvas, on the other hand, provides much more control over the visual appearance of your data, including the options to include custom CSS, images, etc. Think of it as building a PowerPoint presentation based on live Elasticsearch data. Notice how I said ‚Äúlive?‚Äù The data will automatically be updated so you won‚Äôt be dealing with static data. In a nutshell, Canvas is a highly customizable way of presenting your data within Kibana. Here is an example of a so-called Canvas workpad presenting flight data. It includes a custom background, icons, etc. This is still a fairly simple example of what you can do with Canvas, but I am sure you get the idea. The Maps app is a bit special because it‚Äôs also a type of visualization. This means that you can include maps on dashboards, such as for visualizing the geographical location of website visitors. The reason that there is a separate app for maps is that there are a lot of advanced options for configuring maps, and so it makes sense to have a dedicated app for it. You can really do a lot with the Maps app and with its layers in particular. On your screen, you can see an example of flights being plotted onto a map. Another example could be to have a heat map that displays where requests to a website come from. There is so much to cover for this app that I cannot even give you a proper introduction to it here. The Machine Learning app is where we can create machine learning jobs, such as for anomaly detection and analytics. For instance, we might want to monitor the number of requests made to a website and detect if anything unusual happens. This could be a drop in requests, signalling the possibility of a technical issue. Or perhaps an unusual increase in visits, which could be a sign that we need to allocate additional hardware resources. We could also monitor various HTTP status codes, for instance. Another example of what we can do is to forecast future values based on historical data. For instance, it might be worth forecasting future traffic to a website to avoid running out of server capacity. Whatever the case, the Machine Learning app is where we configure machine learning jobs. The Graph app provides an interface for visualizing connections in your data. For example, you can visualize ecommerce orders on a graph; which product categories are most popular for each gender, and in which continent or country? The app uses Elasticsearch aggregations under the hood, so it doesn‚Äôt do any magic that Elasticsearch cannot do. It just provides an interactive interface to explore your data and potentially discover tendencies. While this app does have its uses, I will be honest with you and say that I doubt that you will be using it. Within the Enterprise Search menu group, we have two proprietary search services. App Search is a service that basically lets you set up search functionality super quickly and easily. Building a search engine is not simple, because it involves tuning relevance scores, synonyms, etc. App Search is a service in which you can build search functionality within a user interface, meaning that you don‚Äôt have to get into the details of Elasticsearch. It also includes analytics such as popular searches, which search results are clicked, etc. Workplace Search is a service that searches a number of different content platforms such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Gmail, GitHub, etc. If you have lots of resources scattered across a number of platforms, this Workplace Search unifies the process of searching through all of them. This is probably quite a corporate service. The Observability solution gives you visibility into your applications and infrastructure. It enables you to monitor the health and performance of services and applications. Let‚Äôs go through the observability apps and you will get a better understanding of what observability is all about, in case you are not already familiar with the term. The Metrics app is the place for infrastructure monitoring. Specifically, data coming from Metricbeat. In case you are not familiar with Metricbeat, it‚Äôs a lightweight data shipper that is installed on servers. It ships with a number of modules for popular services. For instance, you can enable the ‚Äúnginx‚Äù module to send nginx metrics to Elasticsearch, including CPU and memory usage. The same can be done for the operating system and Docker containers. Another example could be to monitor the performance of database servers. There are quite a few built-in modules that enable you to easily monitor a number of different services. Most modules ship with pre-configured Kibana dashboards, enabling you to easily visualize the data that is collected. In combination with Metricbeat, the Metrics app is therefore a super convenient way of keeping an eye on your infrastructure to ensure that everything is running as intended. Moving on, we have the Logs app, which is somewhat similar to the Metrics app; instead of dealing with metrics, it just deals with logs. Instead of Metricbeat, it uses Filebeat to collect log data. Filebeat also ships with a number of modules for popular services, such as an ‚Äúnginx‚Äù module for collecting nginx access and error logs. Each module also adds one or more Kibana dashboards for our convenience. Next, we have the APM app, which is an abbreviation of ‚ÄúApplication Performance Management.‚Äù This refers to the process of monitoring how a given application performs. For instance, we can collect information about errors and monitor how often they occur. For HTTP endpoints, we can monitor both the number of requests per minute and the response times over time. This enables us to easily identify if a code deployment resulted in slower response times, for instance. We can also sample individual requests to gain insight into the timeline of the request. For instance, if a request took 92 milliseconds, how much of that time was spent looking up data in a database? And how much was spent retrieving data from a third party API? Using this insight, we can identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the performance of our application. While gaining visibility into an application‚Äôs performance is incredibly useful, it does require a bit of configuration. You need to install an APM server that receives and indexes data into Elasticsearch. And of course an APM agent on the server where the application is installed. This agent then needs to be hooked into your application. Each of the steps are pretty easy, but do require a bit of effort nonetheless. With the Uptime app, we can monitor if hosts or services are available. This app uses Heartbeat to periodically ping hosts and services to check for availability. You can use it to check if a website or API is available, for instance. Heartbeat does the actual work of running the checks and ingesting the results into Elasticsearch, so the app is basically just a visualization of the data. The next solution is named Security, which is the place for security analysis with the Elastic Stack. This solution includes a number of different apps that are targeted security teams including analysts and threat hunters. The apps enable them to analyze host and network related security events. To do this, the solution makes use of various Beats such as Auditbeat, Filebeat, and Packetbeat to gather its data. The data involves everything from network data to monitoring system processes, sockets, and user logins. You can keep an eye on all kinds of different data. The interface is interactive and intuitive so that you can easily dive into the data. That being said, the app is still pretty advanced - at least if you are not familiar with security analysis. I will admit that security analysis is definitely not my speciality, so I haven‚Äôt used this app in production myself. The Dev Tools app unsurprisingly contains a number of development tools. The one that you will most commonly use is probably the Console tool, which you have already seen. Another tool worth mentioning is Search Profiler, which can be used to profile the performance of Elasticsearch queries. When running a query through the tool, you can inspect how much time is used for each step of the query. There is also a tool for testing out Grok patterns, which is useful when writing Logstash pipelines or Elasticsearch ingest pipelines. Lastly, there is a tool for testing Painless scripts, which is the default scripting language used by Elasticsearch. The Ingest Manager app is currently experimental. It offers a user interface for ingesting data into your Elasticsearch cluster from a variety of sources. Within this app, you can configure the Elastic Agent, which sets up and runs Beats on your behalf. The Ingest Manager enables you to control the data collection from within Kibana instead of having to modify configuration files over SSH or something like that. The Stack Monitoring app is for monitoring the Elastic Stack. Within the app, you can gain insight into the performance of the Elasticsearch cluster, Kibana instance, Logstash, Beats, etc. You can find everything from hardware utilization to search and ingestion latencies, index statistics, etc. Pretty much everything you need to monitor the health of your deployment of the Elastic Stack. The Stack Management app exposes a lot of interfaces for managing the Elastic Stack. In the case of Kibana, this is where we can manage index patterns, change advanced settings, and a couple of other things. You have already seen how to create an index pattern as well as how to upgrade the license. There are loads of things we can do within this app, but we are not going to go through them now. Alright, so which of these apps are we going to cover in this course? Well, most of them except the solutions. The reason is that these solutions are use case specific, and they require additional setup in terms of Beats and other services such as web servers. To set everything up, we would be spending most of our time with things that have nothing to do with Kibana. Instead, I am going to cover the parts of Kibana that are not intended for a specific use case. For instance, creating visualizations and dashboards is conceptually the same regardless of whether you are dealing with access logs, ecommerce orders, or restaurant bookings. This makes the course general purpose in terms of Kibana."

Let me know when you're ready to move to the **next transcript**, and we‚Äôll keep going at the same high level of quality. üöÄ

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "Setting the time filter". This transcript is 4 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "Alright, let‚Äôs begin exploring the interface, beginning with the Discover app. Before we get into details with this app, there is one thing we need to talk about first; setting the time filter. By default, the app displays data from within the past 15 minutes. That‚Äôs great under normal circumstances, where data is frequently indexed into Elasticsearch. In the case of HTTP access logs, documents would be streaming in quite frequently, and displaying data for the past 15 minutes would be useful. In our case, however, we need to change the time filter because the access logs that we used as our test data were for the first three months of 2020. That‚Äôs quite a bit in the past by now, so our documents don‚Äôt match the current time filter. The time filter is actually super flexible and handy. If we click the small arrow, we will see a popover with a number of useful presets. Here we can quickly define a time period, such as the past 15 days or five months. Let‚Äôs change the time filter to 15 days, for instance. Apart from that, we can see a number of predefined presets, which are quite handy. We can also see our recently used date ranges, which is convenient if you need to switch between different date ranges. We can also choose to have Kibana automatically refresh data based on an interval that we define. To see any data, we need to define an absolute date range instead of one relative to the current time. We can do that by clicking ‚ÄúShow dates,‚Äù which will allow us to change each of the dates. First, let‚Äôs choose the start date. Here we can choose an absolute date, which is what we need, so let‚Äôs click the ‚ÄúAbsolute‚Äù tab. Let‚Äôs choose the 1st of January 2020 at midnight. Now that‚Äôs done, let‚Äôs set the end date to March 31, 2020, one second before midnight. As for the time, I will enter that manually in the text field. Alright, let‚Äôs click the ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù button to apply the changes. All of our documents now match, because they are within the specified date range. Kibana will remember this date range as you browse around. It might be reset under certain circumstances, in which case you can find the range that we configured within the recently used date ranges. So how does this time filter actually work? Under the hood, the index pattern that we created is actually used. Remember how we chose which date field should be used to filter documents? That‚Äôs the field that is used for the time filter, being the @timestamp field in our case. Lastly, I want to mention that this time filter is actually not specific to the Discover app; a couple of other apps make use of this time filter as well, such as the Dashboard app. We are now almost ready to take a closer look at the Discover app, but first we need to talk about something called the Kibana Query Language."

ChatGPT: 

Excellent ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **crystal-clear breakdown** of the 4-minute transcript titled **‚ÄúSetting the time filter‚Äù** in the **Kibana interface**, specifically within the **Discover app**. Every single point is preserved with intuitive formatting and **interactive icon references** to help you understand each action step by step.

---

## ‚è≥ Introduction: The Importance of the Time Filter

Before diving into exploring the **Discover App**, we must first **set the time filter** ‚Äî a **global setting** that affects what data Kibana displays.

By default, **Kibana only shows data from the last 15 minutes**.

### üîÑ Why is this an issue?

-   This default makes sense for **live streaming logs** (e.g., HTTP access logs) where **data is continuously indexed**.
    
-   **However**, for **historical data** (e.g., logs from Jan‚ÄìMar 2020), **no data will show up** unless we **adjust the time filter**.
    

---

## üïπÔ∏è Step-by-Step: Changing the Time Filter in Kibana

### üñ±Ô∏è Click the **Time Filter** Dropdown

üîΩ Look for a **small arrow dropdown** near the top-right corner of the Discover UI.  
Clicking this will open a **popover menu**.

---

### üìÜ Choose a **Relative Range** (Optional)

You'll see **handy presets** like:

-   Last 15 minutes
    
-   Last 7 days
    
-   Last 5 months
    

üîÅ These **relative ranges** are useful if your data is **recent or continuously updating**.

### üß† Bonus: Recently Used Ranges

üîÑ Kibana remembers the last few ranges you selected, making it easy to **switch back**.

---

### üîÅ Set **Auto-Refresh Interval**

üïí You can define how often Kibana should automatically **refresh** the data.  
Example: Every 30 seconds, 1 minute, etc.

‚úÖ Useful for **live dashboards**.

---

## üîí Setting an **Absolute Date Range** (For Historical Data)

Since your dataset is from **Jan‚ÄìMar 2020**, a **relative filter won‚Äôt work**.  
So instead:

### üß≠ Click ‚ÄúShow dates‚Äù

This opens a **calendar selector** to define an **absolute time range**.

---

### ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Set the **Start Date**

üìç Click the **Absolute** tab  
üìÖ Select: `January 1, 2020`  
üïõ Time: `00:00:00`

---

### ‚û°Ô∏è Set the **End Date**

üìÖ Select: `March 31, 2020`  
üïõ Time: `23:59:59` (manually enter this in the text box)

---

### ‚úÖ Click ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù

üü¢ This applies the new **absolute time filter**.

üéâ Now, you‚Äôll **see documents** that match the historical date range.

---

## üß† Behind the Scenes: How Time Filtering Works

Kibana filters your data **based on the timestamp field** in your documents.

### ‚õìÔ∏è The Role of Index Pattern

During index pattern setup, you chose a **time field**, usually `@timestamp`.

‚åõ The **time filter** you just configured **uses this field** to filter records.

---

## üîÑ Is Time Filter Shared Across Kibana?

Yes!  
üß≠ This **global time filter** is used across **many apps**, including:

-   üîç **Discover**
    
-   üìä **Dashboard**
    
-   üé® **Canvas**
    
-   üìà **Visualize**
    

So when you set a time filter once, it stays **active globally** ‚Äî unless reset.

---

## üßæ Final Notes:

-   If Kibana resets your time filter (e.g., due to a page reload), don‚Äôt worry.
    
    -   You can easily find the **recently used time ranges** to **reapply** it.
        
-   This step is essential before doing **queries or visualizations** on **older datasets**.

### ‚úÖ Now you're ready to dive into the **Discover app**, with the correct time range in place.

Let me know when you're ready for the **next transcript** ‚Äî and we‚Äôll proceed with the same high quality. üöÄ

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "Kibana Query Language (KQL)". This transcript is 9 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "Before we get to exploring the Discover app in detail, we need to talk about the Kibana Query Language, abbreviated KQL. This query language is a central part of the Discover app, but it‚Äôs used in several other apps as well. KQL is a query language in which you can write short and concise search queries to filter documents. Those search queries are then automatically translated into Elasticsearch queries. The purpose of KQL is to support a much more concise syntax than Elasticsearch‚Äôs Query DSL, which is quite verbose. The Query DSL syntax is often not short, and the JSON request body would not look pretty within a text field. KQL‚Äôs syntax is much shorter, but still provides enough flexibility for most queries. Let‚Äôs go through some KQL queries to get you familiar with the syntax. For some of the queries, I will show you the equivalent queries for the Query DSL. Note that for many of them, I have taken the liberty to rewrite the generated Query DSL. The reason is that the KQL is often translated to some very verbose Query DSL, which is hard to read. That‚Äôs just a small price for the flexibility that KQL provides, but I want to keep things as simple as possible for you. Let‚Äôs begin with the simplest example of a KQL query; simply typing in the text that we want to search for. In this example, we search for the terms ‚Äúproducts‚Äù and ‚Äúfischer.‚Äù We could of course have searched for a single term, but I want to show you how Kibana handles a free text search including multiple terms. Free text searches are translated into a multi\_match query that searches all available fields for the specified terms. The type parameter is set to best\_fields, meaning that the best matching field‚Äôs relevance score is used for each document. In the case of queries that contain multiple terms, the results will contain documents that match those terms, regardless of the order in which they appear. This means that switching the terms around has no effect on which documents match the query. If that sounds confusing, then don‚Äôt worry about it, since that‚Äôs just some Elasticsearch specific stuff. If you want to search for a phrase instead, you can surround the terms within quotation marks. In that case the type of the multi\_match query is set to phrase as you can see on your screen. Under the hood, a match\_phrase query is run on each field, requiring the terms to appear in the specified order. While free text searches can be convenient sometimes, we often want to search specific fields. We can do that by specifying the field name followed by an operator and a value. Here is an example of searching for requests that have an HTTP status code of 404. We use the colon operator ‚Äî or the ‚Äúequals operator‚Äù ‚Äî when searching for specific values. You will see which other operators are available in a moment. This KQL query is translated into the following Query DSL. Instead of specifying a number, we can of course also search for text values as follows. As you can see, you don‚Äôt need to enclose the value within double quotes. Not even if you are searching for multiple terms within the same field. If you do, however, the query will be turned into a phrase query, exactly as you saw in the context of free text searches. Instead of specifying a colon ‚Äî being the ‚Äúequals‚Äù operator ‚Äî we can also specify a couple of range operators. You can see the operators on your screen, along with two examples. You just saw how to search a single field for a specific value or range of values. But what if we want to apply more constraints to the search? For instance, we might want to match the requests that had a status code between 200 and 300, being successful requests. We can do that by separating query clauses with a boolean operator, being either ‚Äúand‚Äù or ‚Äúor.‚Äù In this example we use the ‚Äúand‚Äù boolean operator to search for a numeric range with both a lower and upper bound. Kibana generates some really funky Query DSL when using boolean operators, but luckily I have done a bit of magic, so here is what the Query DSL equivalent would look like. As you can see, there is no black magic here. Similarly, we can use the ‚Äúor‚Äù boolean operator to match documents if either side of it evaluates to true. We don‚Äôt need to use the same field on both sides of the boolean operator as in this case, but if we do, there is a handy shortcut that we can use. What we do is to enclose the value after the operator within parenthesis. We can then separate multiple values by a boolean operator. In this example we search for both the 404 and 500 status codes. Alright, so let‚Äôs talk about how we can group query clauses together. Consider the following example. The ‚Äúand‚Äù boolean operator has a higher precedence than ‚Äúor.‚Äù This query therefore matches requests with a path of ‚Äú/brands‚Äù and a status code of 404, OR a status code of 500. What this means is that if the status code is 500, the path can be anything. If I introduce colors to the example, you can see how the query is interpreted, with a document matching if either group evaluates to true. Perhaps that‚Äôs not what we want. We might want to always require the path to equal ‚Äú/brands‚Äù while the status code should be either 404 or 500. We can accomplish that by wrapping parts of the query within parenthesis, which also increases the readability of the query. Query clauses that are surrounded by parenthesis are referred to as groups. We can also invert query clauses by prepending them with ‚Äúnot,‚Äù such as searching for all requests where the status code is not 200. This inversion can also be done for a group, by writing ‚Äúnot‚Äù just before the starting parenthesis. In this example, the status code needs to be 200, but the URL path must not be one listed within the group. Last but not least, we can make use of wildcards within queries. If we only supply a wildcard ‚Äî being an asterisk ‚Äî as the value, this will match all documents that contain the given field. Internally, this query is translated into Elasticsearch‚Äôs exists query. We can also use an asterisk as part of the value instead. This way, paths beginning with ‚Äú/brands‚Äù will be matched. As you can see, this is translated into the query\_string Elasticsearch query. Yet another way in which we can make use of wildcards is to search multiple fields. For instance, it‚Äôs quite common to have a field mapped in two different ways, such as a text field that also contains a keyword mapping. Our test data actually contains a couple of such fields because the fields are mapped according to the ECS specification. For instance, the user\_agent.original field is a keyword field, but it also contains a text mapping. You can see the mapping on your screen now. Let‚Äôs say that we want to search both of these mappings at the same time. We could write that out as follows. That doesn‚Äôt look too bad, but we can shorten it by including a wildcard within the field name as follows. This wildcard actually never reaches Elasticsearch; because Kibana inspects the field mappings, it resolves which fields match the pattern. A match query is then constructed for each matching field, which is what is sent to Elasticsearch. Those were the basics of KQL. There are a couple of things that we haven‚Äôt covered, such as querying nested fields. I will leave you to explore that within the documentation if you need to, so I have attached a link to this lecture. Let‚Äôs wrap up this lecture by briefly talking about the usages of KQL. Why did we spend so much time talking about it? Because it‚Äôs not only used within the Discover app, but rather throughout Kibana. For instance, you can use it to apply a filter to dashboards or even individual visualizations. It‚Äôs therefore quite useful to know the basics of KQL, because you will almost certainly make use of it in one way or another."

Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs your **crystal-clear, comprehensive explanation** of the 9-minute transcript titled **"Kibana Query Language (KQL)"**, complete with examples, visuals, and **interactive icons**.  
No part has been skipped. ‚úÖ

## üß† What is KQL?

### üìå **KQL (Kibana Query Language)** is:

-   A **concise**, **user-friendly search syntax**
    
-   Used across **Discover**, **Dashboards**, **Visualizations**, and more
    
-   **Translated internally** into complex **Elasticsearch Query DSL**
    
-   Designed for **quick filtering** and **field-based search**
    

üßæ Instead of writing long JSON-based queries, KQL allows **simple expressions** like:

```kql
status:404 AND path:"/products"
```

---

## üéØ Why Use KQL Instead of Elasticsearch Query DSL?

| üîπ KQL | üî∏ Query DSL |
| --- | --- |
| Short, readable | Verbose, complex JSON |
| Built into Kibana | Requires JSON knowledge |
| Designed for analysts | Designed for developers |

üß† KQL = good for fast UI filtering  
üîß Query DSL = good for APIs and scripting

---

## üîç Basic Query Types in KQL

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Free Text Search**

Just type a word like:

```kql
products fischer
```

-   Matches **all fields** containing both terms
    
-   Uses `multi_match` with `best_fields` under the hood
    
-   Order doesn't matter ‚Üí `products fischer` = `fischer products`
    

üß™ Equivalent DSL (simplified):

```json
{
  "multi_match": {
    "query": "products fischer",
    "type": "best_fields"
  }
}
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Phrase Search** üó£Ô∏è

Use double quotes to search for **exact phrases**:

```kql
"fischer products"
```

-   Order **does** matter
    
-   Translates to `match_phrase` query
    

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Field-Specific Search** üè∑Ô∏è

```kql
status:404
```

-   Searches for documents where `status = 404`
    
-   Uses `:` as an "equals" operator
    

```kql
status:"Not Found"
```

-   Works with text too ‚Äî quotes optional unless it's a **phrase**
    

---

## üî¢ Range Queries in KQL

You can use operators like:

| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `<` | Less than |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal |
| `<=` | Less than or equal |

Example:

```kql
status >= 200 AND status <= 299
```

---

## üß± Boolean Operators in KQL

KQL supports:

-   `AND`
    
-   `OR`
    

### Example 1: Multiple Clauses

```kql
status >= 200 AND status <= 299
```

üí° Use `AND` to require all conditions.

### Example 2: Alternative Values

```kql
status:404 OR status:500
```

üí° Use `OR` when any condition is acceptable.

---

## üí° Shortcuts for Repeating Field Names

Instead of:

```kql
status:404 OR status:500
```

You can write:

```kql
status:(404 OR 500)
```

‚úÖ Shorter and cleaner

---

## üß© Grouping & Precedence

By default, `AND` has **higher precedence** than `OR`.

### Example:

```kql
path:"/brands" AND status:404 OR status:500
```

This is interpreted as:

```text
(path="/brands" AND status=404) OR status=500
```

But if you want:

```text
path="/brands" AND (status=404 OR status=500)
```

You must group using parentheses:

```kql
path:"/brands" AND (status:404 OR status:500)
```

---

## üö´ Negation in KQL

Use `NOT` to **exclude** values:

```kql
NOT status:200
```

You can negate groups too:

```kql
status:200 AND NOT (path:"/brands" OR path:"/about")
```

‚úÖ Only show documents with `status=200` but not from `/brands` or `/about`.

---

## üßô Wildcards in KQL

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Match Any Value in Field

```kql
status:*
```

üü¢ Translates to `exists` query  
üü¢ Returns documents where the field **exists**

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Wildcard in Value

```kql
path:/brands*
```

‚úÖ Matches `/brands`, `/brands/summer`, etc.  
Translates to `query_string` internally.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Wildcard in Field Name

Used for fields with multiple mappings (e.g., ECS format):

```kql
user_agent.*:"Mozilla"
```

üìå If `user_agent.original` and `user_agent.text` exist ‚Äî both are queried

üîß Kibana resolves matching field names before sending to Elasticsearch

---

## üß™ Example with Dual Field Mapping:

```kql
user_agent.original:"Mozilla" OR user_agent.text:"Mozilla"
```

This can be shortened as:

```kql
user_agent.*:"Mozilla"
```

üí° Faster and more scalable

---

## üìå Nested Fields (Not Covered Here)

You can query nested documents in KQL, but it‚Äôs **more advanced**.  
üìö Check Kibana docs if you need this for JSON objects inside fields.

---

## üåç Where is KQL Used?

-   üîç **Discover App** ‚Üí Filtering logs/documents
    
-   üìä **Dashboards** ‚Üí Global or widget-specific filters
    
-   üé® **Visualizations** ‚Üí Slice data by user-specified KQL
    
-   üìã **Canvas / Lens** ‚Üí Optional filters
    
-   üìà **Alerts & Monitors** ‚Üí Trigger based on query results

## üß≠ Interactive Summary

| Feature | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| üîç Free Text Search | `products fischer` | Searches all fields |

## üì¶ Final Thoughts

‚úÖ KQL is **essential** in Kibana. Even if you're just **building dashboards** or **exploring data**,  
you‚Äôll use it often to filter logs, metrics, and user data.

üìö Learn the syntax now ‚Üí **Save hours later**.

Let me know when you're ready for the **next transcript** ‚Äî and I‚Äôll give it the same care and clarity. üöÄ

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "Discover app". This transcript is 13 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "Now that you know the basics of KQL and we have configured the time filter, we are ready to explore the Discover app in more detail. At the top of the app, we have a search bar. Here you can enter any KQL query with which you can narrow down the matching documents. KQL is used as the query language by default, but this can be changed to the Lucene syntax instead. That‚Äôs rarely used, though, and unless you are familiar with the Lucene format, you should leave this at KQL. Even though we haven‚Äôt entered any query yet, the documents have already been filtered. That‚Äôs because the time filter causes Kibana to construct a range query for the @timestamp field. The matching documents are actually stored in three different indices, being one for each month within the date range. That‚Äôs because Kibana queries all indices matching our index pattern. Our index pattern for the access logs dataset has been chosen by default. That‚Äôs just because we created that one first, and so it was automatically set as the default one. We can change the default index pattern within the Stack Management app. Alternatively we can choose a different index pattern here in case we don‚Äôt want to work with this one. On the left hand side, we can see which fields are available within the matching indices. We can filter the fields with a search field, which can be useful if you have a lot of fields. We can also filter by field types. This enables us to filter based on data types or whether or not fields can be used in aggregations or searches. We can click on a field to show the distribution of top values for a field. Let‚Äôs find a field where this makes sense. I‚Äôll go with the country name I suppose. Here we can see the top 5 values for the field, revealing that most of our requests came from the United States. This feature only samples a subset of documents, so these percentages do not represent the total number of documents with those values. It is, however, a convenient way of quickly gaining insight into field values. It should be said that these percentages are not necessarily based on all documents. Suppose that we have filtered documents to only match those with a browser of Safari. In that case the percentages are based on that search context and not all documents. I just wanted to make that clear. The ‚ÄúVisualize‚Äù button creates a visualization with this data, which you can then save and use on dashboards, for instance. That‚Äôs just a convenient shortcut so you don‚Äôt have to configure the visualization from scratch. The small plus and minus icons enable us to add filters based on the values. The one with a plus sign in it adds a filter to only match documents containing that value. The other one does the opposite, i.e. matches all requests that do not contain that value for the field. Both can be quite convenient when digging into the data. We can clearly see that most of the requests came from the United States. We could use that information to inspect those requests and look for tendencies. For instance, matching requests from the United States, we could have a look at which user agents are popular for that country, which may be different compared to other countries. Instead though, let‚Äôs click to filter out those documents, just for the sake of an example. Looking at the top of the page, we can see that a filter has been added. The part of the app that displays the matching documents has a bar chart at the top, showing the number of requests over time. This is based on a histogram aggregation. By default, Kibana automatically determines the interval that each bar represents. Since our date range is just for a couple of months, Kibana determines that the count can be displayed just fine for each day. If you choose a larger date range, you will likely see the document count for each week instead. If you want, you can override this behavior through the dropdown menu. Below the bar chart the matching documents are displayed. The entire \_source object is displayed by default alongside the timestamp, but I will show you how to change this in just a moment. If we click the arrow to the left of a document, we can expand it to get a prettier and more detailed view of the document. Now that we have expanded the document, we can see the fields and their values within a table instead, which is easier for the eyes to process. Apart from fields, the table also contains some metadata that was returned from the search query, such as the relevance score. We can also view the document as JSON instead if we want to. Let‚Äôs head back to the table view, though. If we hover over a row, a few controls show up. Let me just find the row for the url.path field as an example. The plus and minus icons do the same thing as you saw a moment ago. Apart from those, there is an icon for only matching documents that have a value for the field. The last icon lets us add or remove the field from the table. In this case, ‚Äútable‚Äù refers to the preview of the documents. Let me show you what I mean. I will just close the expanded view of the document for a second so you can see what I mean. As you can see, only the timestamp and the url.path field is displayed in the table now, making the table look much simpler. This is a useful feature if you are just interested in a subset of the available fields, or if you just want to make the table easier to look at. The same thing can actually be accomplished within the list of available fields that we talked about a moment ago. If I hover over one of the fields, you will see a button to add the field to the table. Let‚Äôs add the HTTP status code. As you can see, the field has been added to the table. One last thing before moving on. You can sort the documents within the table by one or more fields. Simply hover over a field in the table‚Äôs header and click the two small arrows. The documents are sorted by the @timestamp field in descending order by default. If we click on the small triangle, the sort order will be changed to ascending instead. The first time you click, the field will be sorted in ascending order. It‚Äôs possible to sort by more than one field if we want to. Within the header, you can also remove fields from the table or rearrange them. Alright, let‚Äôs get back to the search field now. It‚Äôs probably no surprise that we can enter any of the KQL queries that I showed you in the previous lecture. I am not going to show you any new syntax, so I will just enter a simple query. I do want to show you that Kibana actually has auto-completion, which is super helpful when writing out queries. Suppose that we ‚Äî for whatever reason ‚Äî want to only include requests made from the Windows operating system. The operating system is derived from the HTTP user agent, which is part of HTTP access logs. When processing the access logs, the user agent strings were also parsed because they are otherwise hard to work with. As a result, we can find the name of the operating system within the user\_agent.os.name field. As I begin typing, notice how Kibana displays a number of options, including field names and any past searches that we might have made. We can simply click the field that we want to search with the mouse, or alternatively by using the arrow keys and Enter on our keyboard. Note that there is a text mapping for this field as well, but in this case we want to use the keyword mapping, which is the one I chose. Next, we need to choose an operator. Kibana suggests a couple based on the type of the chosen field, which is quite convenient. Let‚Äôs go with the ‚Äúequals‚Äù operator. Conveniently, Kibana suggests the top values that appear within our documents, so we can easily just select a value. I‚Äôll go with ‚ÄúWindows.‚Äù That‚Äôs it for our simple KQL query. As you can see, Kibana also helps you construct boolean queries if that‚Äôs what you need. Kibana‚Äôs auto-completion feature is actually pretty cool and helpful, at least in my opinion. To apply the query, simply click the ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù button or hit Enter on your keyboard. The bar chart and the documents below it have now been updated to reflect the new query. Besides writing KQL, Kibana has a convenient interface for constructing queries; namely filters. We already have one filter, which we added from within the field list. Let‚Äôs click to add another one. First, we naturally need to select the field to which we wish to apply the filter. Let‚Äôs go with the url.path field. As for the operator, let‚Äôs choose the ‚Äúis‚Äù operator, which is the same as the ‚Äúequals‚Äù operator. I am not sure why it is named differently here to be honest. Lastly, let‚Äôs choose a value. As you can see, Kibana conveniently displays the values that we have indexed for the field. Let‚Äôs go with the front page, being a forward slash. If we want to, we can give the filter a label that will appear below the search bar. Otherwise Kibana will automatically generate one for us, exactly as with our existing filter. I will just go ahead and save the filter. After a short moment, we can see that the filter is reflected within the table. Now that we are searching for a specific value, this is also highlighted within the table. That‚Äôs not so useful right now because we have customized the table, but when the \_source object is displayed instead, it is helpful. Last but not least, let‚Äôs see how we can save searches. Before saving our search, though, I am just going to remove the filter that excludes requests from the United States, since that search is probably not reusable. I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt be shocked to hear that we save searches by clicking the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù link at the top. Saving a search gives us the opportunity to reuse the results when creating visualizations. Let‚Äôs try to give the search a meaningful title. Perhaps you noticed that the page reloaded after saving the search. If we pay close attention, we can see that the breadcrumb has actually changed, indicating that we are now on a page specific to the search that we just saved. And, if we inspect the page‚Äôs URL, we can see that a UUID has been added to the path. The reason for this is that when saving a search, Kibana doesn‚Äôt just save the query; it also saves information about how we configured the page. A couple of examples are the index pattern, fields within the table, sorting of fields, etc. Let‚Äôs try to reset the app by navigating to it again through either the menu or breadcrumb. This resets the state of the app. To get back to the search that we were working on, we can simply click the ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù link and choose the saved search. And with that, we are back where we left off. That marks the end of this walkthrough of the Discover app. This app is super useful if you want to do some ad hoc analysis of your data or if you just want to explore it."

Each value (e.g., ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù) shows:

| Icon | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ‚ûï | Include only this value |
| ‚ûñ | Exclude this value |

Clicking either adds a **visual filter chip** under the search bar.

‚úÖ Helps you drill into/exclude parts of your data **with zero typing**.

## üìä Top Graph: Histogram of Requests Over Time

-   Shows **count of documents** (requests) over time
    
-   Based on `@timestamp`
    
-   **Auto-adjusts interval**:
    
    -   Small time range ‚Üí daily bars
        
    -   Large time range ‚Üí weekly/monthly bars
        
-   You can override the interval manually via dropdown
    

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Document Table

Below the graph is the **raw document viewer**:

-   Displays `_source` JSON content by default
    
-   Also shows selected fields and timestamps
    

### üîΩ Expand a Document

Click the **arrow on the left** to:

-   View fields in a **tabular view**
    
-   Check **relevance score**
    
-   Switch between:
    
    -   üßæ Table view
        
    -   üß± JSON view
        

---

## üéõÔ∏è Table Controls (Hover Over Field Rows)

| Icon | Function |
| --- | --- |
| ‚ûï | Filter by this value |
| ‚ûñ | Exclude this value |
| üëÅÔ∏è | Show only documents **having this field** |
| üìã | Add/Remove field to/from the document preview table |

### üõ† Customizing the Table

-   You can **add/remove fields** from both:
    
    -   The expanded document view
        
    -   The sidebar field list
        
-   Let's say you only care about:
    
    -   `@timestamp`
        
    -   `url.path`
        
    -   `status`
        

Then just **remove everything else** for clarity.

---

## üîÉ Sorting the Table

You can **sort documents** by:

-   `@timestamp` (default: descending)
    
-   Any other field (click column header)
    
-   Multiple fields (add more sort levels)
    

‚úÖ Useful when scanning through logs chronologically or by status code.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing KQL Queries in Discover

Enter **any KQL query** directly in the search bar.

### ‚ú® Auto-Completion Features:

-   Suggests:
    
    -   Field names (e.g., `user_agent.os.name`)
        
    -   Operators (`:`, `>`, `<`, etc.)
        
    -   Top field values (`Windows`, `Mac`, etc.)
        
-   Use:
    
    -   ‚å®Ô∏è Arrow keys + Enter
        
    -   üñ±Ô∏è Click with mouse
        

üí° Use `user_agent.os.name: "Windows"` to match Windows users

‚úÖ Kibana prefers **keyword fields** for filters  
‚ùó Avoid querying on `text` fields directly (analyzed)

---

## üìê Alternative to KQL: GUI Filters

Besides writing queries, you can also create filters visually.

### ‚ûï Add a New Filter

Steps:

1.  Click **Add filter**
    
2.  Choose field (e.g., `url.path`)
    
3.  Choose operator (`is` = equals)
    
4.  Choose value (e.g., `/`)
    
5.  (Optional) Add a label
    
6.  Click **Save**
    

üß† Kibana auto-suggests values from data!

‚úÖ Now, this appears as a **filter chip** under the search bar  
‚úÖ Filters are **combined with KQL**

‚úÖ Let me know when you‚Äôre ready to move to the **next transcript** ‚Äî I‚Äôll continue with the same quality and care.

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "Saving Queries". This transcript is 3 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "In this lecture, we are going to talk about how to save queries. In case you are wondering if we didn‚Äôt just do that, then no; we saved a search, not a query. Those are two different features, although there is some overlap between the two. Saving a search is specific to the Discover app, since that also saves additional information besides the query and filters. Saving a query only saves any KQL query that has been entered, along with any filters. Queries can be saved within multiple apps and not just within the Discover app. Both can be used to create visualizations, so in that sense they are quite similar. If you don‚Äôt need to save anything other than the KQL query and filters, then you should save a query. Let‚Äôs see how to do that. I have the Discover app opened up with the saved search from the previous lecture. Like I said, queries can be saved in a number of apps, so this is just an example. To save a query, simply click the disk icon to the left of the search bar. This is where we both save and open saved queries. Let‚Äôs click to save the current query. First, we need to give the query a name. I will just use the same name as with the search, although I will write that it‚Äôs a query, just to be explicit. Although the description is optional, I will just enter a placeholder description, just for the sake of it. Next, we can choose whether or not we also want to save the filters. You will typically want to do that, but if you are only interested in saving the KQL query, then you can uncheck this option. We can also choose to save the time filter as part of the query. What this does, is that when the query is loaded, the time filter is also applied automatically. That is especially useful when the time filter is set to a relative date range unlike in our case, such as the past 30 days. I‚Äôm not going to include the time filter in this case. That‚Äôs all we need to do, so let‚Äôs save the query. Nothing changed on the page, but let‚Äôs reset the state of the Discover app by navigating to it again. The state of the app has now been reset apart from the time filter, so let‚Äôs go ahead and load the query that we just saved. That‚Äôs also done by clicking the disk icon, followed by the name of the query. Notice how the table shows the \_source object, which is the default behavior for the Discover app. That‚Äôs because only the query and filters were saved, not the configuration of the app. That‚Äôs it for saving and loading queries. It‚Äôs a quite useful feature for building a query within the Discover app, for instance, and then building a visualization based on the saved query."

ChatGPT: 

Absolutely ‚Äî here's a **crystal-clear, complete walkthrough** of the **"Saving Queries"** lecture in Kibana (3 mins long). Even though it‚Äôs short, it introduces a **crucial distinction** that‚Äôs often misunderstood.

Let‚Äôs break it down with üí° clarity, üß† reasoning, and üß≠ interactive icons.

---

## üí° What‚Äôs the Difference?

| Feature | Saved **Search** üìã | Saved **Query** üîç |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App-specific | ‚úÖ Only in **Discover** | ‚ùå Used **across apps** |
| What it saves | KQL + Filters + Table layout | ‚úÖ KQL + Filters |
| Used in | Dashboards, Visualizations | Dashboards, Visualizations |
| Saves time filter? | ‚ùå Optional | ‚úÖ Optional |
| Saves table columns, sorting, etc.? | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |

üß† Think of it like this:

-   **Saved Search** = full workspace snapshot (Discover only)
    
-   **Saved Query** = portable logic block (used everywhere)
    

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Save a Query in Kibana

### Step-by-Step

1.  **Open any app** (Discover, Visualize, Dashboard)  
    üß™ In this case, we‚Äôre using **Discover** with a previously saved search
    
2.  üñ±Ô∏è Click the **disk icon** üíæ left of the search bar  
    This handles both **saving** and **loading queries**
    
3.  üìù Fill the form:
    
    -   **Name**: Give it a name (e.g., `Status:Windows Query`)
        
    -   **Description** (optional): Add helpful context for teammates
        
    -   **Include Filters?** ‚úÖ Yes (recommended)
        
    -   **Include Time Filter?**
        
        -   ‚úÖ If you're working with *relative time ranges* (e.g., "last 30 days")
            
        -   ‚ùå Skip if using an *absolute range* or want flexibility
            
4.  ‚úîÔ∏è Click **Save**
    

---

## üîÑ Loading a Saved Query

To reload the query:

1.  Reset the app (e.g., navigate away ‚Üí return to Discover)
    
2.  Click the **disk icon** again üíæ
    
3.  Select your saved query name from the list
    

üéØ Only the **KQL** and **filters** will be restored  
üìÇ The table view, sorting, fields ‚Äî **will not be** restored (because this isn‚Äôt a saved search)

---

## üß™ Example Use Case

Let‚Äôs say:

-   You build a KQL like `status:(404 OR 500) AND user_agent.os.name:"Windows"`
    
-   You want to **re-use this logic** across dashboards and visualizations
    

üëâ Save it as a **query**, and:

-   Use it while building **dashboards**
    
-   Reference it in **multiple visualizations**
    
-   Share it with teammates who want to reuse just the logic
    

---

## üß≠ Summary with Interactive Icons

| Icon | Feature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| üíæ | **Disk Icon** | Save/load queries globally |
| üîç | **Saved Query** | Stores only KQL + filters (and optional time filter) |
| üìã | **Saved Search** | Stores everything about the Discover app layout |
| ‚è≥ | **Include Time Filter** | Makes saved queries auto-apply time range |
| üß™ | **Use in Other Apps** | Queries can be reused across dashboards & visualizations |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

-   Use **Saved Queries** when you want **reusability** across Kibana
    
-   Use **Saved Searches** when you want **layout + filters + table config**
    
-   Kibana gives you both tools ‚Äî pick the right one based on your workflow!

Let me know when you‚Äôre ready for the **next transcript** ‚Äî I‚Äôll maintain this level of clarity all the way through. üöÄ

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "Inspecting requests". This transcript is 2 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "Sometimes you might want to check which queries Kibana sends to Elasticsearch, and perhaps inspect the responses as well. This can be useful to understand how your KQL queries are translated into Elasticsearch‚Äôs Query DSL. The same applies when building visualizations as you will see in the next section of the course. Whatever the case, some apps contain an ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù link at the top. I have the Discover app opened up with our saved search loaded. Let‚Äôs see which queries were sent to Elasticsearch for this page. Here we can see that a single request was sent to Elasticsearch, along with some statistics about it. Perhaps more interesting, let‚Äôs check what the query actually looked like, by navigating to the ‚ÄúRequest‚Äù tab. This tab contains the entire Query DSL for the query. I will just point out a couple of things as I scroll through the query. First, we can see that the results are sorted by the @timestamp field in ascending order, which is a result of clicking the field within the table. Next, we can see that a date\_histogram aggregation was added to the query, which is used to generate the bar chart at the top of the Discover app. Scrolling down to the query key, we can see how our KQL query and filter was translated into a bool query. Last but not least, a range query is added based on the date range that we chose. There is really nothing magical about this query, as it is fairly simple. That being said, it can sometimes be useful to inspect which query is actually sent to Elasticsearch ‚Äî especially for more advanced use cases. Navigating to the ‚ÄúResponse‚Äù tab, we can see the entire JSON object that Elasticsearch responded with. It might take a couple of seconds for the tab to load, because the JSON object might be quite large. That‚Äôs the case in this example, because Kibana retrieves 500 documents, which are all included within this object. Anyway, this is the object that you get back from all searches, such as within the Console tool that I showed you a bit earlier. That‚Äôs really all I wanted to show you in this lecture. Check out the Inspect feature anytime you want to see what is going on under the hood, for whatever reason."

ChatGPT: 

Absolutely! Here's your **crystal-clear explanation** of the **"Inspecting Requests"** feature in Kibana, based on the 2-minute transcript. Even though this is short, it‚Äôs a **powerful capability** that offers a window into what Kibana is doing behind the scenes ‚Äî a key for debugging, optimization, and learning.

Let‚Äôs explore this, with ‚ú® **no part skipped**, and üß≠ **interactive icons** to bring it to life.

---

## üïµÔ∏è What Is ‚ÄúInspecting Requests‚Äù?

The **Inspect** feature in Kibana lets you:

-   üîç View the **actual Elasticsearch Query DSL** Kibana sends
    
-   üì¶ Examine the **raw response** returned by Elasticsearch
    
-   üìä Understand how **visualizations** and **KQL filters** translate into **backend queries**
    

---

## üß≠ Where Is It Found?

In apps like:

-   üîç **Discover**
    
-   üìä **Visualizations**
    
-   üìã **Dashboards**
    

You‚Äôll find a **‚ÄúInspect‚Äù link** near the **top-right corner** (typically a small button).

---

## üß™ Let‚Äôs Walk Through an Example in Discover

Imagine you're in **Discover** and have loaded a **Saved Search**.

1.  üîé Click the **Inspect** button
    
2.  A panel opens ‚Äî usually with **two main tabs**:
    
    -   **Request**
        
    -   **Response**
        

---

### üì• ‚ÄúRequest‚Äù Tab ‚Äì What Was Sent

This shows the full **Elasticsearch Query DSL** that Kibana sent.

Let‚Äôs highlight some key parts:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `sort` Clause

```json
"sort": [
  { "@timestamp": "asc" }
]
```

‚û°Ô∏è Reflects that the documents are sorted by `@timestamp` (e.g., from a click in the table header)

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `aggs` Clause ‚Äì Histogram

```json
"aggs": {
  "2": {
    "date_histogram": {
      "field": "@timestamp",
      "calendar_interval": "1d"
    }
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è This builds the **bar chart** at the top of the Discover app using a **date histogram aggregation**

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `query` Clause

```json
"query": {
  "bool": {
    "filter": [
      { "term": { "user_agent.os.name": "Windows" } },
      { "range": { "@timestamp": { "gte": "...", "lte": "..." } } }
    ]
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è This is how your **KQL query** and **filters** are translated into **Elasticsearch's bool + filter** syntax

‚úÖ Now you can verify or optimize how Kibana queries are built.

---

### üì§ ‚ÄúResponse‚Äù Tab ‚Äì What Was Returned

This shows the **entire JSON payload** Elasticsearch responded with.

üí° By default, **500 documents** are returned in Discover ‚Äî so the response is **large**.

You‚Äôll find:

-   ‚úÖ Matched documents (under `hits`)
    
-   üìä Aggregation buckets (e.g., histogram values)
    
-   üìÑ Metadata (shard stats, total hits, etc.)
    

üïì Loading might take a moment ‚Äî especially with large datasets.

## üîß Use Cases for the Inspect Feature

| Use Case | Why It‚Äôs Useful |
| --- | --- |
| üß† **Learn** | Understand how KQL maps to Query DSL |
| üß™ **Debug** | Ensure queries are built as intended |
| üìà **Optimize** | Spot slow or overly complex queries |
| üîß **Dev Workflows** | Reuse or modify raw queries in Dev Tools (Console) |

---

## üß≠ Interactive Summary

| Icon | Tab | What You See |
| --- | --- | --- |
| üì• | **Request** | Full query DSL sent to Elasticsearch |
| üì§ | **Response** | Raw JSON response with hits + aggregations |

Let me know when you‚Äôre ready for the **next transcript**, and we‚Äôll continue our journey through Kibana together! üöÄ

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "How Kibana handles time zones". This transcript is 7 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "In this lecture I want to briefly talk about how Kibana handles time zones. I have the request from the previous lecture opened up, because I want to show you something that you may or may not have noticed. If we scroll down a bit, we can find the range query that Kibana adds for us. This query uses the @timestamp field that we configured for our index pattern. It then specifies the timestamps from the time filter. Well, almost. Notice how the first date is actually in 2019 and not in 2020. And the other timestamp is not at midnight as it is within the time filter. So what‚Äôs going on here? The reason for this is that Kibana automatically converts dates to the UTC time zone when constructing the query. We can see that because the timestamps both end with the letter ‚ÄúZ.‚Äù That‚Äôs a way of specifying that a timestamp is in the UTC time zone for timestamps that are formatted according to the ISO 8601 specification. So which time zone were the timestamps converted from? By default, Kibana uses the browser‚Äôs time zone. In my case that‚Äôs UTC offset by either one or two hours, depending on the time of the year due to daylight savings time. That‚Äôs why one hour is subtracted from the first timestamp, and two hours from the other one. So the dates that I chose within the time filter are for my local time zone, which are then converted to UTC. That‚Äôs convenient in most cases because it means that users will not have to work with UTC timestamps. Suppose that we are working for a company that has offices in several parts of the world, including London and New York. If users in the two offices choose the same timestamp within the time filter, they will actually be converted to different UTC timestamps ‚Äî and as such the Elasticsearch query will differ. On the map, you can see how the first timestamp from the time filter would be converted and differ by five hours. Like I said, this is usually convenient, because then people don‚Äôt have to do this time zone conversion themselves. It‚Äôs not just the dates within the time filter that are localized, though; pretty much all dates that are displayed within Kibana are converted to our local time zone. This includes the ‚ÄúTime‚Äù column within the Discover app, which you can see here. Not only are these dates formatted, they are also converted to our local time zone. If we were to inspect the JSON that is returned from Elasticsearch ‚Äî which you know how to do ‚Äî we would see that the two dates are different. More specifically, Elasticsearch returns the dates in the UTC time zone, whereas Kibana formats them based on our browser‚Äôs time zone. While having Kibana work with local time zones is usually convenient, there are some scenarios in which it‚Äôs not ideal. For instance, suppose that we have an ecommerce website running in the United States with the access logs being stored in the UTC time zone. We have a line chart showing the average number of HTTP requests per hour of the day for the past week. An employee from the New York office then signs into Kibana. He or she will see the following line chart with the dates being converted to the local time zone instead of UTC. Taking a look at it, we can see that the majority of our traffic is between noon and 6 PM. Now suppose that an employee from the London office signs in and views the same visualization. The time zone will be adjusted to his or her local time zone, causing the line chart to look different. If we didn‚Äôt know better, we might conclude that the majority of the traffic is between 5 PM and 11 PM. That‚Äôs clearly not the case ‚Äî at least not in the web server‚Äôs local time. In this example it could lead us to inadvertently make the wrong decisions based on a simple time zone conversion. In such a scenario it might make sense to override the time zone instead of using the browser‚Äôs local time. Even if I am using Kibana from the London office, I probably want to see dates in the New York time zone, since the website is intended for an American audience. If the website were meant for a British audience, on the other hand, we wouldn‚Äôt have to change a thing. Localized timestamps are therefore mainly an issue when different people open Kibana from different time zones. In fact, that‚Äôs exactly the case for us in this course. I am located in Denmark, but you guys are from all over the world. Our test data is for the first three months of 2020 based on the UTC time zone. You saw how my time filter caused an offset of one to two hours. Suppose that one of you is from Sydney, Australia. In that case, setting the same time filter as me would yield the following timestamps in UTC. That‚Äôs an offset of 11 hours. The conversion of the first timestamp actually means that the date changes to the last day of 2019, being the 31st of December. Our dataset doesn‚Äôt contain any access logs for that month, so effectively it doesn‚Äôt make any difference. It does for the other timestamp, on the other hand. This timestamp is also offset by minus 11 hours, meaning that any access logs within the last 11 hours of our dataset are not included. Again, it doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference with our test data, but I do want you to be aware of it, as it can cause bigger trouble in other scenarios. To make sure that we see the same thing independently of any time zone differences, let‚Äôs set the Kibana time zone to UTC. I will show you how to do that in the next lecture, so I will see you there!"

ChatGPT: 

Here‚Äôs your **crystal-clear explanation** of the **7-minute transcript** titled **"How Kibana Handles Time Zones"**, complete with üîç technical clarity, üß† real-world context, and üß≠ interactive icons.  
No part has been skipped ‚Äî let‚Äôs break it down.

---

## üåê Why Does Time Zone Handling Matter in Kibana?

Kibana works heavily with **timestamps** (especially `@timestamp`) for filtering, charting, and dashboards.  
To make things easier for users around the world, **Kibana auto-converts all dates to your local time zone by default**.

While convenient, this behavior can sometimes cause **inconsistent or misleading results** across teams in different time zones.

Let‚Äôs explore what really happens under the hood.

---

## ‚è≥ Example: Inspecting a Query Range

Imagine you applied a time filter in Discover for:

```yaml
Start: Jan 1, 2020 00:00:00  
End: Mar 31, 2020 23:59:59
```

When inspecting the request sent to Elasticsearch (`Inspect` ‚Üí Request tab):

### ‚ùó You‚Äôll notice:

-   The actual query shows timestamps like:
    
    ```json
    "gte": "2019-12-31T23:00:00Z"
    "lte": "2020-03-31T21:59:59Z"
    ```
    
-   These are **not identical** to what you picked.
    
-   Dates are **converted to UTC** (the `Z` at the end means "Zulu time" = UTC)
    

---

## üåç Where‚Äôs the Offset Coming From?

Kibana **detects your browser‚Äôs time zone** (e.g., UTC+1 for Denmark).  
It then **subtracts the offset** from your selected time to convert it to UTC.

üß† This is done for consistency ‚Äî Elasticsearch stores and compares timestamps in UTC.

---

## üìä Real-Life Scenario: Multiple Offices

Imagine a company with teams in:

-   üïê New York (UTC‚Äì5)
    
-   üïî London (UTC+0)
    

If **both users pick ‚ÄúJan 1, 2020 00:00:00‚Äù** in the Kibana UI:

-   Kibana sends different UTC values:
    
    -   New York: `2020-01-01T05:00:00Z`
        
    -   London: `2020-01-01T00:00:00Z`
        

‚û°Ô∏è The underlying query changes  
‚û°Ô∏è The results change  
‚û°Ô∏è Same time filter ‚Üí different data = üòï

## üßæ More Places Where Time Zone Conversion Happens

-   **Time Filter** (top-right global time range)
    
-   **Time column in Discover**
    
-   **Visualizations / Charts**
    
-   **Dashboard Panels**
    
-   **Tooltips and Aggregation Buckets**
    

All these are **shown in your browser‚Äôs local time zone** unless overridden.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: Misleading Visualizations

Let‚Äôs say:

-   Your web server logs are in UTC
    
-   You chart **‚ÄúRequests per hour‚Äù** over 1 week
    

### üßë‚Äçüíº User from New York sees:

> üìà Traffic peak from **12 PM ‚Äì 6 PM**

### üßë‚Äçüíº User from London sees:

> üìà Traffic peak from **5 PM ‚Äì 11 PM**

‚ùå Wrong business conclusions might be made because of **timezone-based shifts**

## üß™ Real Impact for This Course

The test dataset used in this course is:

-   üóÇÔ∏è Logs from **Jan‚ÄìMar 2020**
    
-   Stored with `@timestamp` in **UTC**
    

### ‚ö†Ô∏è You (the learner) might be in:

-   üá©üá∞ Denmark (UTC+1 ‚Üí +2 DST)
    
-   üáÆüá≥ India (UTC+5:30)
    
-   üá¶üá∫ Australia/Sydney (UTC+11)
    

Your time filter will be **auto-converted** to UTC:

| You Selected (Local) | Sent to Elasticsearch (UTC) |
| --- | --- |
| Jan 1, 2020 00:00 | Dec 31, 2019 13:30 (Sydney) |
| Mar 31, 2020 23:59 | Mar 31, 2020 12:59 (Sydney) |

‚úÖ ‚úÖ Dates look right locally,  
‚ùå ‚ùå But your **actual range shifts**

---

## üéØ What‚Äôs the Consequence?

-   You might **exclude relevant data** unintentionally
    
-   Reports and charts may **misalign between users**
    
-   **Confusion** when teams collaborate from different time zones
    

---

## üõ†Ô∏è When Should You Override the Time Zone?

Use **browser time zone** if:

-   It‚Äôs a **localized project**
    
-   All users are in the **same time zone**
    
-   You want charts in the user‚Äôs **local context**
    

Override with **fixed time zone (e.g., UTC)** if:

-   Data is logged in UTC (e.g., server logs)
    
-   Teams work **across time zones**
    
-   You want **consistent results** for dashboards

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

-   **Kibana auto-converts to UTC** behind the scenes
    
-   This is **helpful**, but can **cause inconsistency** in shared dashboards
    
-   Be aware of it, especially when:
    
    -   Comparing data
        
    -   Collaborating globally
        
    -   Interpreting visual patterns

You: 

Thanks , here we go for the next one. It's "Changing Kibana's Time Zone". This transcript is 3 mins long , so don't rush up and you must not ignore any part of the transcript. Provide a crystal clear explanation with interactive icons. "Us potentially working with different time zones can result in a few minor differences, so let‚Äôs make sure that we are working with the same time zone. We can do that by heading to the Stack Management app. Once there, click the ‚ÄúAdvanced Settings‚Äù link within the ‚ÄúKibana‚Äù group. If we scroll down just a little bit, we should find the time zone setting. As you can see, the setting defaults to ‚ÄúBrowser.‚Äù Let‚Äôs change that to ‚ÄúUTC‚Äù to match our test data. While we are here, I will actually change the first day of the week as well, since weeks begin on Mondays where I live. Alright, we are all done, so let‚Äôs save the changes. We need to reload Kibana for the changes to take effect, so let‚Äôs click to do that. Now that Kibana has been reloaded, let‚Äôs head over to the Discover app. Notice how our date range is different now. That‚Äôs because it was created for my local time zone, being UTC offset by one to two hours. When we changed Kibana‚Äôs time zone to UTC, the date range was converted to UTC. This caused the timestamps to be offset by one and two hours, respectively. So to get the time filter synced up with our test data, we just need to change it back to what it was before. This time around the time filter will be for the UTC time zone. Alright, let‚Äôs update the data. As the last time, I just want to prove to you that this worked by inspecting the query once again. As you can see, the query indeed specifies the same dates that we chose within the time filter. The dates were already in the UTC time zone, and so no conversion was necessary. Alright, enough about dates and time zones. Let‚Äôs now move on to some more interesting Kibana features!"

ChatGPT: 

Here‚Äôs your **crystal-clear explanation** of the 3-minute lecture titled **"Changing Kibana‚Äôs Time Zone"** ‚Äî short, but critical for achieving **data consistency across teams**, especially when working with historical or UTC-based datasets.

No skipping. Let‚Äôs go step-by-step, with üß≠ interactive icons and üîç practical visuals.

## üï∞Ô∏è Why Change Kibana‚Äôs Time Zone?

Kibana defaults to your **browser's time zone**, which:

-   üß≠ Is fine if everyone is in the same region
    
-   ‚ùå But problematic when working with **UTC-based logs** or **global teams**
    

To avoid inconsistencies, especially for test datasets stored in **UTC**, you should **explicitly set Kibana‚Äôs time zone**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Change Kibana's Time Zone

### Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to **Stack Management**

üìç Menu ‚Üí **Stack Management**

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Go to **Advanced Settings**

üõ†Ô∏è Inside Stack Management, find the **Kibana** section ‚Üí Click **Advanced Settings**

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scroll to **Time Zone for Date Formatting**

üïí Look for the setting labeled:

```makefile
dateFormat:tz
```

By default, it's set to:

```nginx
Browser
```

üåç This means Kibana formats all time data based on **your system/browser time zone**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Change to **UTC**

üïõ Change the value from:

```nginx
Browser
```

to:

```nginx
UTC
```

‚úÖ This ensures that:

-   Time filters
    
-   Visualizations
    
-   Date displays  
    ‚Üí all **align with UTC timestamps** stored in Elasticsearch
    

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Set First Day of Week

üìÖ If you prefer weeks to start on **Monday** (common in Europe), change:

```makefile
dateFormat:dow
```

From:

```scss
0 (Sunday)
```

To:

```scss
1 (Monday)
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Save & Reload

üíæ Click **Save Changes**  
üîÅ Kibana prompts you to **reload the app** ‚Äî do it for changes to take effect.

---

## üîç Validate the Change in Discover

1.  Go to **Discover App**
    
2.  Observe the **time filter range**
    
    -   It may look shifted due to the **previous local time zone setting**
        
    -   Update it to match the original intended UTC time range
        

### üîÅ Reapply:

```yaml
Start: Jan 1, 2020 00:00:00 UTC  
End: Mar 31, 2020 23:59:59 UTC
```

‚úÖ Now everything is in **UTC**, no more conversion needed.

---

## üß™ Final Validation: Use Inspect Tool

1.  Click **Inspect** (top-right)
    
2.  View the **Query ‚Üí Range** timestamps
    
3.  Confirm that the **@timestamp filter** matches exactly what you selected in the UI
    

‚úÖ Success ‚Äî no offset applied, timestamps are **true UTC**.
